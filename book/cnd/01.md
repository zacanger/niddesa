> 2 &middot; [The Blessed One: "Ajita!"]  
The world is surrounded by ignorance,  
Because it is stingy and unrestrained.  
I say that craving is its adherence,  
And suffering is its great horror.

"The world is enveloped by ignorance": "Ignorance," ignorance of suffering,
ignorance of the path leading to suffering, ignorance of the past, ignorance of
the future, ignorance of the past and the future, ignorance of the specific

world of human beings, the world of heaven, the world of aggregates, the world
of realms, the world of being, this world, other worlds, the world of Brahma,
the world of heaven, are called the world. This world is enveloped, covered,

liberation; the establishment (of the pseudonym) for the acquisition and
testimony of the Buddha, the Blessed One, under the Bodhi tree, and all

"Because of being stingy and unrestrained, is it not shining": Being stingy is
the five types of stinginess: (right) living stinginess, household stinginess,
gaining stinginess, praise stinginess, dhamma stinginess, everything like this
stinginess, stingy state, greed, heart clenched state, this is called stingy. In
addition, the accumulation of stinginess is also stingy; stinginess in the world
is also stingy; being stingy in opinion is also stingy, this is called stingy.
In evil deeds of the body, or in evil deeds of speech, or in evil deeds of
intention, or in the five desires, being restrained is be turned away, the
heart's abandonment does not arise, or the practice of good Dhamma is not
respected. The state of impermanence, the state of non-stop working, the state
of being stuck to the habit, the state of neglecting desire, the state of
neglecting responsibility, not practicing, not practicing much, not
establishing; relaxation; anything like this state of letting go, this is called
being unrestrained. "Because of being stingy and relaxation does it not shine":
The world is not shining, not illuminating, not bright, not being known because
of this stinginess and relaxation.

"I say that craving is its adhering": Aspiration is called craving, that is

suffering from dead fathers, from dead brothers, dead sisters, dead children,
the dead daughters, the suffering of relatives' loss, the suffering of the loss
of wealth, the suffering of the loss of disease, the suffering of the decline of
precept, the suffering of the decline of seeing. For all dhammas, from the
beginning, it was known; from extinction, to extinction, it was known, the
retribution is based on kamma; kamma is based on kamma, form is based on name;
name is based on form. Those who are followed by birth, accompanied by birth,
followed by old age, conquered by disease, struck by death, sheltered in
suffering, no shelter, no return, and no refuge are called suffering. This
suffering is the world's terror, great terror, oppression, blow, evil, and
disaster.

> 6 &middot; (The Blessed One:) When you ask this question, Ajita,

With the extinguishing of consciousness,  
They are destroyed.

> 7 &middot; (Ajita:) Those who know the Dhamma,  
And everyone learning here,  
When I ask the wise one about their behavior,  
Dear sir, Please tell me.  
[SN.12.31]

"Those know know the Dhamma": Those who perceive the Dhamma are called Arahants,
those who have exhausted their troubles. For what reason is the enlightened
person called an Arahant, a person who has exhausted their troubles? They are
the perceivers of the Dhamma, the knowers of the Dhamma, the measurers of the
Dhamma, the judges of the Dhamma, the clear ones. "All actions are impermanent,"
the perceiver of the Dhamma, the knower of the Dhamma, the weigher of the
Dhamma, the judge of the Dhamma; "all actions are suffering"..., "all action is
no-self"..., "action is based on ignorance"..., "all dhammas are
extinguished".... Or, to them, it is the enlightened person of the aggregate,
the enlightened person of the realm, the enlightened person of the place, the
enlightened person of coming-around, the enlightened person of rebirth, the
perceiver of reincarnation. Or, they are the inhabitants of the ultimate
(boundary), the ultimate in the world, the ultimate in the place, the ultimate
in the place of going around, the ultimate in the rebirth, those who live the
ultimate, those who have the ultimate, those who are the ultimate in rebirth,
those who are the ultimate in the cycle, the Arahant who holds the last body.

"(In the uncountable tribulations,  
They are the ones who gain the body,)  
This is their last, final body.  
The reincarnation of life and death,  
Without their rebirth."  
[Thag.202]

For this reason, the enlightened person is called an Arahant, a person who has
exhausted their troubles. "Those who know the Dhamma, and everyone learning
here": "There is learning," for what reason are they said to be learning? "They
learn," hence learning. And what do they learn? They learn to increase precepts,
they learn to increase mind, and they also learn to increase wisdom.

What is meant by "to increase precepts?" Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who
lives in the protection of self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient
righteousness and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns
after accepting from a teacher. Small precepts aggregate and large precept
aggregates are the foundation of abstinence, the (self) inhibition of behavior,
the entrance of self-control, the uppermost of good dhamma, etc., this is to
increase precept learning.

What is meant by "to increase mind?" Here, the bhikkhu starts from the desire to
escape... (omitted) the first jhāna..., the second jhāna..., the third jhāna...,
after entering, he lives in the fourth jhāna (neither suffering or joyous, from
calm and chanting), this is "to learn to increase mind."

What is learning to increase wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a wise person,
possessing the knowledge of arising and passing away; the holy, insight, and the
complete extinction of suffering is (the wisdom), he truthfully knows "This is
suffering. ...(omitted)" "this is hard work."... "this is the path that leads to
suffering"... "these are troubles"... "this is the set of troubles"... "this is
annoyance"... "this is the path leading to troubles;" this is the addition of
wisdom. These three learnings, they learn when they face (note); they learn when
they know; they learn when they see (; when they learn with introspection); they
learn when the mind is established (in a decision); they learn when faith
prevails; they learn with vigor and hard work; when mindfulness arises, they
learn; when mind is set (focused) they learn; when wisdom is learned, they
learn; when they are proved to have known, they learn; they learn through
renunciation; they learn when they practice; they practice well, and sustain
when they are testified, then they go on. For this reason they are called
learning. "Everyone" is the multitude. These learned practitioners are the
Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmī, Anāgāmī, and Arahant. "Here," in this view, in this
liking, in this inclination, in this proposition, in this Dhamma, in this
teaching, in this practice, in the teachings of this Master, in this individual,
in this human world.

"When the wise are asked about their behavior, my dear sir! Please tell me": You
are the wise and enlightened, who knows the Dhamma and learned the behavior,
conduct, practice, travel, residing, and path. "Are asked," being questioned;
begging, being inquired of; make it clear. "Please tell": please explain, please
teach, .... "Dear Sir," ....

> 8 &middot; (The Blessed One:) You should not be greedy in desire,  
And your mind should not be muddy,  
Being a skillful person of all dhammas,  
The bhikkhu should wander mindfully.

"Should not be greedy in desire": "Desire," there are two types of desires: the
desire for things and the desire for pollution. What are the desires for things?
Desirable sight, sound, smell, taste, touch; bedding, clothing, maidservants,
goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, mules, horses,
fields, houses, gold, gold coins, villages and towns, capitals, countries,
territories, treasuries, warehouses; everything that can be tainted by greed is
the desire for things.

In addition, there are past desires, future desires, present desires, internal
desires, external desires, internal and external desires, inferior desires,
medium desires, superior desires; desires in the suffering world, human desires,
heavenly desires, existing desire, created desire, uncreated desire, created
desire by others, possessed desire, unpossessed desire, cherished desire,
non-cherished desires; the desires of all the worlds of desire, the desires of
all the worlds of physicality, all the desires of the world of non-material
worlds, dependence on thirst and desire for love, desiring righteousness, greed
for righteousness, the desire to be intoxicated by righteousness and happiness,
is called the desire for things.

What is the desire for defilement? The desire for desire, the desire for greed,
the desire of desire to greed, the desire of intention, the desire for lust, the
desire for intention, the joy of desire, love obsession, the binding harness of
desire, attachment, the desire for cover.

"Seeing those roots of desire,  
Wanting to be produced by thought (intention),  
I will not think of them,  
So desire will not exist."  
[Jat.8.421]

These are called polluting desires. Craving thirst, attachment, it is greed,
lust... (omitted) unwholesome roots. "Should not be greedy in desire": In the
desire to pollute, one should not be greedy, or obstructed in the desire of
things, should be separated from greed, and those who have excluded greed, have
been freed from greed, have renounced greed, have no greed, have eliminated
greed, those who have attained the cessation of greed, have no hunger and
thirst, those who have extinguished, have become cool, and feel joy, should live
as a Brāhmaṇa.

"Mind should not be muddy": "Mind": all the heart, mind, heart, white (clean),
meaning, intentions, consciousness, corresponding to that consciousness. With
evil acts of the body, the mind becomes turbid, agitated, moving, impacting,
volatile, fluctuating, rotating, and restless; acting evil with words...
(omitted), acting evil with intention..., with greed..., aversion..., with
ignorance..., with anger..., with resentment..., in hiding evil..., with
domineering..., with jealousy..., with stinginess..., with hypocrisy..., with
cunning..., with stubbornness..., with passion..., with conceit..., with
arrogance..., with relaxation..., with all pollution..., with all evil deeds...,
with all troubles..., with all the heat (of suffering)...; the unwholesome mind,
turbid, agitated, volatile, fluctuating, rotating, and restless. "The mind
should not be muddy": The mind should not be cloudy: not disturbed, not shaken,
not moved, not rotated, calmed down, and all pollution should be abandoned,
should be discarded, should be driven away, should be ended, should be made to
cease to exist; one should be separated from muddiness and pollution, quashed,
abstained, separated, left, liberated; free from bondage, one should live with
an unrestrained heart.

"This is a skillful person of all the Dhamma": "All actions are impermanent",
the skillful one in the Dhamma knows; "all actions are suffering"..., "all
actions are without self"..., "ignorance is the cause of all deeds"....

Or (seeing as) impermanent, the skillful person in all dhammas; it is
suffering... (omitted), it is disease..., it is the tumor..., it is the arrow...
the curse..., the other side..., corruption..., disaster..., movable...,
perishable..., unstable..., it is no refuge..., is miserable..., the root of
misfortune..., hypocritical..., empty..., selfless..., it is the dhamma of
impermanence..., the murderer..., increasing..., bait..., is life..., the method
of old age..., the method of sorrow and despair..., of pollution...,
pleasure..., the extinction..., the trouble..., a good man who renounces for the
skillfulness of all dhammas.

Or, the person skillful with the aggregates, ...of the would, ...of the place,
...with dependent origination, of mindfulness, righteousness, the divine bases,
...of the root, of power, of consciousness, of support, of the Path, of the
Fruit, of Nibbāna.

Or, all dhammas are called the twelve sense bases: eyes and forms, ears and
sounds, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and touch, mind and dhamma; and
because of desire and greed in the inner and outer parts of oneself being cut
off, the roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming
a non-existent, non-living thing for the future.

"Bhikkhus should march (wander) mindfully": "Mindfully" in four ways: when
practicing mindfulness on the body, when practicing mindfulness on perception,
when watching the mind in the heart, when the practice is in line with the
teachings, it is mindful.

And again in four ways: the state of avoiding non-mind, the state of the Dhamma
that should be done to the mind, the state of the Dhamma that is obstructed by
the mind, the state of the mindfulness factor (phase) not being forgotten.

And again in four ways: the state of possessing mindfulness, the state of
abiding in mindfulness, the state of experiencing mindfulness, and the state of
mindfulness not lowering.

And again in four ways: with the state of being mindful as the object of
mindfulness, the quiet state as the object, the calm state as the object, the
state of silence; the recollection of the Buddha, the recollection of the
Dhamma, the recollection of the Saṅgha, the precepts, the alms, of the mind;
mindfulness of the in and out breath, of death, of the body, of silence; all
mindfulness, free-mindfulness..., the path without a fork, are called
mindfulness. Having been fully possessed, reaching fully, possessing, arriving,
with this thought, he is called mindful. "Bhikkhu," he who destroyed the state
of the seven dhammas is called Bhikkhu; seeing is destroyed, suspicion is
destroyed, prohibition..., greed..., anger..., delusion..., sloth...; those evil
and unwholesome dhammas are destroyed: shunning pollution (defilement), the
others, the fear, the bitter fruit, will no longer live for the future.

The Blessed One [Sn.3.6, 519]:  
"By their own practice,  
To Nibbāna, transcending skeptics,  
After abandoning nothingness and existence,  
The one who has been completed,  
The one who is extinct, he is a Bhikkhu."

"Bhikkhus should march mindfully": Bhikkhus should proceed mindfully, walk
mindfully, stand mindfully, sit down mindfully, lie down mindfully, go forward
mindfully, step back..., look forward..., observe..., bend..., straighten...,
hold coats, bowls, and clothes mindfully, walk and live mindfully, act, go on,
guard, survive.

---

At the end of the verse, for those who live with the same intention, same
endeavor, same inclination, and same dwelling place as the Brāhmaṇas, the
distant dust and dhamma eyes of thousands of living things arise: "Any
collection of dhammas is an extinction." The mind of the Brāhmaṇa is free from
all defilements without clinging. Along with reaching the realm of the Arahant,
their sheepskin clothing, knotted hair, bark clothing, sticks, long-mouthed
water bottles, hair, and beards disappeared, becoming bald, replaced with robes,
cloth clothes, overcoats, and bowls. They clasp their hands together to show
respect to the Blessed One, and sit down: "Great Virtue! The Blessed One is my
teacher, and I am a disciple."
