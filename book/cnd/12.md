### 12. Bhadrāvudha

> 70 &middot; [Venerable Bhadrāvudha like this:]  
Those who abandon the family, those who cut off the thirst,  
Those who are not disturbed, those who abandon the joyful,  
Those who have survived the torrent, those who are free,  
Those who have abandoned construction, the extremely wise,  
I beg; after hearing from the nāga, they will leave here.

"Those who abandon the family, cut off the thirst, and are not disturbed":
"Abandon the family," all the desires, greed, joy, thirst, clinging, and
attachment to the physical realm, the trend of troubles; those who have been cut
off, as the Buddha and the Blessed One, have their roots cut off, just like a
palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and non-living things for the
future. Therefore, the Buddha is the one who has abandoned his family. In the
realm of feeling... (omitted) in the realm of thinking..., in the realm of
action..., all the desires, greed, joy, thirst, clinging, clinging, attachment
of the heart, clinging, troubles in the realm of consciousness, the underlying
trend, for the Buddha and the Blessed One, has been cut off, and the roots have
been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and
non-living things for the future. Therefore, the Buddha is a homeless person.

"Cut off thirst," "Thirst" for form, sound thirst, smell thirst, taste thirst,
touch thirst, dhamma thirst, torrent, harness, binding, clinging, obstacles,
covering, defilements, potential trends of troubles, entanglement, vines,
stinginess, suffering roots, causes of suffering, occurrence of suffering,
magical nets, magical hooks, magical food, the realm of the devil, the residence
of the devil, the state of the devil, the bondage of the devil, the river of
thirst, the net of thirst, the rope of thirst, the sea of thirst, craving,
greed, and the root of unwholesomeness. For the Buddha and the Blessed One, the
craving has been cut off, calmed down, ceased, unable to arise, and burned by
the fire of wisdom; therefore, the Buddha is the one who cuts off the craving.
"Undisturbed": Disturbance is called craving, which is the root of greed, that
is greed, lust, acquiescence, conformity, joy, desire, obsession, taking,
contaminated, disturbance, fraud, (reincarnation) root cause, (bitter)
fertility, tailoring (greed), net, river, bondage, rope, attachment,
accumulation, companionship, desire, intimate interaction, forest, jungle, love,
expectation, relationship, desire for form, desire for sounds, desire for
smells, desire for tastes, desire for touches, desire for acquisition, desire

greedy appearance, possessing greed, inquiring for profit, illegal greed,
improper greed, hope, envy, desire for desire, desire for nothingness, desire
for form, formless thirst, extinguished thirst, form thirst, sound thirst, ....
Disturbance and thirst have been cut off for the Buddha and the Blessed One, and
the roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming
non-existent and non-living in the future. Therefore, the Buddha is the
undisturbed. Regarding the state of dismissing disturbance as the undisturbed,
the Blessed One does not shake when he gets it (obtains something); he does not
shake when he does not; he does not shake when he has reputation; he does not
shake when he has no reputation; he does not shake when praised; he does not
shake when he is reprimanded; he does not shake when he is happy; he does not
shake, move, does not tremble, does not tremor when suffering; therefore, the
Buddha is the one who is not disturbed.

the connection of words; this is the order of sentences, which is "like this."
"Venerable," this is a synonym of love, respect, respect, and obedience. This is
"Venerable." "Bhadrāvudha," the name, title, security, common name, appellation.

"Those who give up joy, those who have survived the torrent, and those who are
liberated": Happiness is called craving, that is greed, ...(omitted). That joy
and thirsty love, for the Buddha and the Blessed One, it has been cut off, and
the roots have been cut off...; therefore, the Buddha is the one who has given
up the joy. Excessively violent (stormy) people, those who have passed the
violent currents of being, those who have passed the violent currents of view,
those who have passed the violent currents of ignorance, all cycles have been
passed, surpassed, transcended, overcome, he is the one who has descended into
the state, the one who has practiced.... "The liberated," the heart of the
Blessed One is already freed from greed, liberated from greed, from anger, from
ignorance, from all unwholesome creations, ....

"Abandon the construction, the extremely wise, I plead": "Construction" has two
constructions: the construction of desire and the construction of seeing....
This is the construction of desire.... This is the construction of seeing....
For the Buddha and the Blessed One, the construction of thirst has been cut off,
the construction of seeing has been cut off, ...; therefore the Buddha is the
abandoner of construction. "I want to beg," I want to beg, I want to plead, I
want to request, I want to accept, I want to hope, I want to aspire, I want to
ask, I want to pray. Extreme wisdom is called wisdom, .... The Blessed One
reaches....; therefore, the Buddha is an extremely wise man.

"They will leave here after hearing from the nāga (noble one, or elephant)":
"The noble one" is the nāga. The Blessed One "does not commit crimes" is the
noble one; "does not go" is the noble one; "does not come" is the noble one. How
is "the Blessed One does not commit a crime" a noble one? Crime is called evil
unwholesome dhamma: following pollution, re-existing, fearful, bitter, future
life and death.

The Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 527]  
"He who does not commit any crime in the world,  
After leaving all bonds and ties,  
Does not cling to everything and is freed.  
Those like this are truly called noble ones."

because of hatred; not because of ignorance; not because of conceit; not because
of views; not because of disbelief; not because of doubt; not because of
potential troubles; not be carried away by quarrels (disharmony), walk, led, be
taken.

How is "The Blessed One is not coming" as a noble one? Any pollution that is cut
off by the Sotāpanna Path, the pollution he no longer experiences, does not
return, and does not go back; by the Sakadāgāmī Path...; by the Anāgāmī Path...;
by the Arahant Path....
