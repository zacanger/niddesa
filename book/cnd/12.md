### 12. Bhadrāvudha

> 70 &middot; [Venerable Bhadrāvudha like this:]  
Those who abandon the family, those who cut off the thirst,  
Those who are not disturbed, those who abandon the joyful,  
Those who have survived the torrent, those who are free,  
Those who have abandoned construction, the extremely wise,  
I beg; after hearing from the nāga, they will leave here.

"Those who abandon the family, cut off the thirst, and are not disturbed":
"Abandon the family," all the desires, greed, joy, thirst, clinging, and
attachment to the physical realm, the trend of troubles; those who have been cut
off, as the Buddha and the Blessed One, have their roots cut off, just like a
palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and non-living things for the
future. Therefore, the Buddha is the one who has abandoned his family. In the
realm of feeling... (omitted) in the realm of thinking..., in the realm of
action..., all the desires, greed, joy, thirst, clinging, clinging, attachment
of the heart, clinging, troubles in the realm of consciousness, the underlying
trend, for the Buddha and the Blessed One, has been cut off, and the roots have
been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and
non-living things for the future. Therefore, the Buddha is a homeless person.

"Cut off thirst," "Thirst" ....(omitted, see previous sections). For the Buddha
and the Blessed One, the craving has been cut off, ...and burned by the fire of
wisdom, therefore, the Buddha is the one who cuts off the craving.

...(omitted, see previous sections). Disturbance and thirst have been cut off
for the Buddha and the Blessed One, and the roots have been cut off, just like a
palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and non-living in the future.
Therefore, the Buddha is the undisturbed. Regarding the state of dismissing
disturbance as the undisturbed, the Blessed One does not shake when he gets it
(obtains something); he does not shake when he does not; he does not shake when
he has reputation; he does not shake when he has no reputation; he does not
shake when praised; he does not shake when he is reprimanded; he does not shake
when he is happy; he does not shake, move, does not tremble, does not tremor
when suffering; therefore, the Buddha is the one who is not disturbed.

"[Like this Venerable Bhadrāvudha]": ...(omitted, see previous sections).

"Those who give up joy, those who have survived the torrent, and those who are
liberated": Happiness is called craving, that is greed, ...(omitted). That joy
and thirsty love, for the Buddha and the Blessed One, it has been cut off, and
the roots have been cut off...; therefore, the Buddha is the one who has given
up the joy. Excessively violent (stormy) people, those who have passed the
violent currents of being, those who have passed the violent currents of view,
those who have passed the violent currents of ignorance, all cycles have been
passed, surpassed, transcended, overcome, he is the one who has descended into
the state, the one who has practiced.... "The liberated," the heart of the
Blessed One is already freed from greed, liberated from greed, from anger, from
ignorance, from all unwholesome creations, ....

"Abandon the construction, the extremely wise, I plead": "Construction" has two
constructions: the construction of desire and the construction of seeing....
This is the construction of desire.... This is the construction of seeing....
For the Buddha and the Blessed One, the construction of thirst has been cut off,
the construction of seeing has been cut off, ...; therefore the Buddha is the
abandoner of construction. "I want to beg," I want to beg, I want to plead, I
want to request, I want to accept, I want to hope, I want to aspire, I want to
ask, I want to pray. Extreme wisdom is called wisdom, .... The Blessed One
reaches....; therefore, the Buddha is an extremely wise man.
