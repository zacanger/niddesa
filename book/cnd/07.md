Nor by knowing, Nanda,  
Do the skillful people here say one is a Muni,  
Those who live a life without suffering or desire  
After leaving the legion, I call them "Muni."

"Not by seeing (views), not by hearing (teachings), not by knowing (wisdom)":
"Not by seeing," not by seeing is there purity. "Not by hearing," not by being
pure by hearing. "Not by wisdom," not by eighth ultimate wisdom, not based on
the five gods, nor is it based on the evil wisdom.

army with body and evil; acts as a demon army with speech and evil; ...greed;
hatred; infatuation ...(omitted, see previous sections)..., all bad works as a

And thirst (love) is called fourth.  
Deep sleep is your fifth,  
Fear is said to be sixth,  
Doubt is your seventh,  
And stubbornness is your eighth.  
He who has a respectful reputation,  
And the reputation gained by mistakes (wrongfully),  
Who would praise oneself and contempt others.  
Devil! This is your legion,  
Evil (black) attacker,  
Those who have no courage will not defeat him,  
And they will get peace after victory."

When all the demon army and all the hostile pollution are conquered, defeated,
destroyed, disintegrated, and turned away by the Four Holy Paths, then this is
called "after leaving the legion". "No distress," greed is distress, anger...,

I don't say "all the Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas are shrouded by birth and aging;"  
After anything you see or hear or feel here,  
Or even the precepts and prohibitions, are all abandoned,  
After knowing thirst and love, the trouble-free people,  
I say those people have indeed survived the torrent.

"[The Blessed One: 'Nanda!'] I don't say, 'All Samaṇa and Brāhmaṇas are shrouded
by birth and aging'": "Nanda! I don't say, 'All Samaṇa and Brāhmaṇas are
hindered by birth and aging, blocked, enveloped, obstructed, closed, hidden,' I
say, .... There are those Samaṇa and Brāhmaṇas for whom birth, aging, and death
have been cut off, and their roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree
without roots, becoming non-existent, non-living things for the future.

"Anything seen or heard here, or even precepts and prohibitions, are all
abandoned": Anything you see is pure after abandoning, after forsaking, after
discarding, after being driven away, after finishing, after making it go to
non-existence; all things heard are pure after giving up... (omitted), all
feelings..., all things seen, heard, and perceived..., precepts...,
prohibition..., all the precepts and prohibitions are purely abandoned, after
discarding, after being driven away, after finishing, and making them go beyond
existence.

"All kinds of forms are all abandoned": With all kinds of forms, there is
purity and cleanliness; detachment, liberation, release, after renunciation,
after disengagement, after abandonment, after finishing, and making it going to
non-existence.

"After knowing thirst, the trouble-free people, I said, 'Those people have
indeed survived the torrent'": The thirst for form, ...sound, ...smell, taste,
touch, ...the Dhamma. "After the knowing the thirst for love," There are three
kinds of knowing the thirst for love: knowing knowing, measuring knowing, and
giving up knowing. What is knowing knowing? Knowing the craving: this is the
craving for form, ...sound, ...smell, taste, touch, Dhamma. Knowing and seeing,
this is knowing.

What is measuring knowing? After knowing this, eager to measure impermanence,
suffering, sickness... (omitted), he makes the measure of renunciation, which is
the measure of knowing.

What is renunciation knowing? After weighing in this way, he eagerly abandons
thirst, drives away, makes to end, and makes it go to non-existence. This was
said by the Blessed One: Bhikkhus! All the desires and greed of craving must be
cut off. In this way, that craving will be cut off, and the roots will be cut
off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent for the future
[SN.22.25]. This is renunciation knowledge. "After knowing thirst and love,"
with these three kinds of knowing, knowing thirst for love. There are four kinds
of worries in "worry-free person": worries of desire, some worries, worries of
seeing, worries of ignorance. For them, these troubles have been cut off,
...(omitted, they are called trouble-free people, Arahants, and those who have
exhausted their troubles.

"I said 'Those people have indeed survived the torrent'": Those who have no
troubles after knowing thirst, I say, I explain, ...that the violent currents of
desire have passed; violent currents of being have been surpassed; the violent
currents of seeing have been surpassed; the violent currents of ignorance have
been passed; all the circuits have been passed, have come out, have been
transcended, have overcome.

> 52 &middot; (Nanda:) I rejoice at great rishi's words;  
Well said, Gotama, is the state without dependence,  
After abandoning anything you see or hear or feel here,  
Or even the precepts and prohibitions,  
After all kinds of forms have been cut off, after knowing thirst and love,  
Those who have no troubles, I also say they survive the torrent.
