Among the desires, there are Brāhmaṇas  
Who are always mindful and detached from desire.  
After considering, this extinguished Bhikkhu,  
For him there is no wavering.

"There are Brāhmaṇas, among the desires": "Desire," there are two kinds of
desires: the desire for things and the desire for pollution. What are the
desires for things? Desirable sight, sound, smell, taste, touch; bedding,
clothing, maidservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows,
horses, mules, horses, fields, houses, gold, gold coins, villages and towns,
capitals, countries, territories, treasuries, warehouses; everything that can be

medium desires, superior desires; desires in the suffering world, human desires,
heavenly desires, existing desire, created desire, uncreated desire, created
desire by others, possessed desire, unpossessed desire, cherished desire,
non-cherished desires; the desires of all the worlds of desire, the desires of
all the worlds of physicality, all the desires of the world of non-material
worlds, dependence on thirst and desire for love, desiring righteousness, greed
for righteousness, the desire to be intoxicated by righteousness and happiness,
is called the desire for things.

What is the desire for defilement? The desire for desire, the desire for greed,
the desire of desire to greed, the desire of intention, the desire for lust, the
desire for intention, the joy of desire, love obsession, the binding harness of
desire, attachment, the desire for cover.

"Seeing those roots of desire,  
Wanting to be produced by thought (intention),  
I will not think of them,  
So desire will not exist."  
[Jat.8.421]

These are called polluting desires. Craving thirst, attachment, it is greed,
lust... (omitted) unwholesome roots. "Should not be greedy in desire": In the
desire to pollute, one should not be greedy, or obstructed in the desire of
things, should be separated from greed, and those who have excluded greed, have
been freed from greed, have renounced greed, have no greed, have eliminated
greed, those who have attained the cessation of greed, have no hunger and
thirst, those who have extinguished, have become cool, and feel joy, should live
as a Brāhmaṇa.

Brāhma is called separation, abstinence, withdrawal, renunciation, departure,
inaction, no offense, and no transgression from non-rectification, etc. Or, with
no difference, Brāhmaṇa is called the eight branches of the holy path, namely:
right view, right will, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right
diligence, right mindfulness, right concentration. Those who have fully
possessed, entered, walked in, these eight holy paths, he is called a Brāhmaṇa.
For example, he is called a "property person" by property; he is called a person
with wealth; he is called a person with reputation; and he is called a person
with technology. Skilled people; precepts are called "precepts;" one with vigor
is called a "vigorous one;" ones with wisdom are called "wise ones;" in the same
way, anyone who possesses, fully possesses..., these eight noble paths, he is
called a Brāhmaṇa.

"Metteyya," the Blessed One calls the Brāhmaṇa by his surname. "The Blessed One"
is synonymous with respect. In addition, the "greed breaker" is the Blessed One;
the "sickness destroyer" is the Blessed One; "the one who has destroyed conceit"
is the Blessed One; "the one who has destroyed the thorns" is the Blessed One;
"the one who has destroyed the pollutants" is Blessed One; "the one who has
ended" is the Blessed One; "the one who has practiced the body, the precepts,
the mind, and the wisdom" is the Blessed One; or "the Blessed One is close to
the woods, wild forests, and border dwellings (sitting place), where speaking is
lessened, it is quiet, away from the human atmosphere, alone, and suitable for
sitting alone" is the Blessed One; or "the Blessed One is the one who divides
clothes, food, shelter, the needs of patients, and medical necessities"; or "the
Blessed One is the one who has the taste of righteousness, the taste of Dhamma,
the taste of liberation, the increased precepts, the mind, and the wisdom"; or
"the Blessed One is the four kinds of jhāna, the four immeasurables, the four
formlessness, etc., the one who divides is the Blessed One"; or the Blessed One
is the one who has the eighth liberation, the eight victories, the ninth
dwelling place, etc.; or the Blessed One is the practice of ten thoughts, (ten)

divided is the Blessed One; or the Blessed One divides the four mindfulness, the
four righteousness, the four divine bases (iddhipāda), the five faculties, the
five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, and the eight branches of the holy
path; or the Blessed One is ten Tathāgata, four fearlessness, four unobstructed
solutions, six supernatural powers and the six enlightenment methods. "Blessed
One," this name is not given by the mother; not given by the father; not given
by brothers; not given by sisters; not given by friends; not given by relatives;
not given by Samaṇas or Brāhmaṇas; not given by heaven; it is ultimate
liberation; the establishment (of the pseudonym) for the acquisition and
testimony of the Buddha, the Blessed One, under the Bodhi tree, and all
knowledge and wisdom, that is, the Blessed One.

"Always mindful, detached from desire": The desire of "desire for love" is the
thirst for dhammas. For him for whom the desire for love has been cut off and
calmed down, halted, unable to arise, burned away by the fire of wisdom, he is
called the one who is detached from thirst, the one who abandons thirst, the one
who eliminates thirst, the one who releases the thirst, the one who dismisses
the thirst, the one who renounces the thirst, those who are not greedy, those
who abandon greed, who exclude greed, free themselves from greed, renounce
greed, those who do not hunger and thirst, those who have become cool, those who
feel happy, those who regard themselves as Brāhmaṇas. "Always," always,
everything, all the time, eternally, constantly, continuously, uninterrupted,
successively; like waves in water waves arising without pausing; in the morning,
afternoon, first watches of the night, midnight, last night; in the black moon,
bright moon, rainy season, winter, summer; in youth, middle age, and old age.

The "person mindful of" is mindful in four ways: when practicing mindfulness on
the body, when practicing mindfulness on perception, when watching the mind in
the heart, when the practice is in line with the teachings, it is mindful.

And again in four ways: the state of avoiding non-mind, the state of the Dhamma
that should be done to the mind, the state of the Dhamma that is obstructed by
the mind, the state of the mindfulness factor (phase) not being forgotten.

And again in four ways: the state of possessing mindfulness, the state of
abiding in mindfulness, the state of experiencing mindfulness, and the state of
mindfulness not lowering.

And again in four ways: with the state of being mindful as the object of
mindfulness, the quiet state as the object, the calm state as the object, the
state of silence; the recollection of the Buddha, the recollection of the
Dhamma, the recollection of the Saṅgha, the precepts, the alms, of the mind;
mindfulness of the in and out breath, of death, of the body, of silence; all
mindfulness, free-mindfulness..., the path without a fork, are called
mindfulness. Having been fully possessed, reaching fully, possessing, arriving,
with this thought, he is called mindful.

"Bhikkhu," he who destroyed the state of the seven dhammas is called Bhikkhu;
seeing is destroyed, suspicion is destroyed, prohibition..., greed..., anger...,
delusion..., sloth...; those evil and unwholesome dhammas are destroyed:
shunning pollution (defilement), the others, the fear, the bitter fruit, will no
longer live for the future.

The Blessed One [Sn.3.6, 519]:  
"By his own practice,  
To Nibbāna, transcending skeptics,  
After abandoning nothingness and existence,  
The one who has been completed,  
The one who is extinct, he is a Bhikkhu."

"After considering it, this extinguished bhikkhu": After consideration, it is
called wisdom, understanding, simple selection, investigation, discernment,
recognition, discrimination, close observation, inspection, learned virtuous
wisdom, proficiency, cleverness, study, reflection, review, contemplation,
examination, general comprehensive wisdom, vipassanā, right knowledge, stabbing
rod, wisdom root, wisdom sword, wisdom palace, wisdom brightness, wisdom light,
no delusion, choice of dhamma, right view. "After consideration," after knowing,
after understanding, after measurement, after judgment, after separation, after
clarification: "all activities are impermanent" after consideration...,
"everything is suffering..., "all things are non-self"..., "arising from
ignorance"..., "any collection of dhammas is an extinction of dhammas"....

Or, (seen as) the consideration of impermanence, after knowing..., it is
suffering..., it is disease..., it is tumors..., it is the arrow....
"Extinguished," the state of creating greed is extinguished, of anger, of
ignorance, of resentment, hate, hiding of evil, domineering (arbitrariness,
bossiness, tyranny), jealousy, stinginess, falseness, cunning, stubbornness,
passion, sloth, torpor, discomfort, all pollution, all evil deeds, all troubles,
all irritation, all heat (of torment), all unwholesome contrived things.
"Bhikkhu," the one who has destroyed the state of the seven dhammas is a
Bhikkhu... (omitted); the one who has been completed and the one who has been
destroyed is a Bhikkhu.

"There is no wavering for him": "For him," for the Arahant, for the one who has
exhausted his troubles. "Wavering," the wavering of craving, the wavering of
seeing, ...of sloth, ...of pollution, ...of desire, for him these waverings do
not exist, are not known, are not found, and have been cut off, calmed down,
ceased, unable to arise, burned by the fire of wisdom.

> 11 &middot; After knowing both sides,  
By consideration he is not stuck in the middle,  
I say he was a "great man,"  
And he surpasses the tailor here.  
[AN.6.61]

"Knowing both sides, after considering it, he will not be contaminated in the
middle": "Side," touch (contact) is one side, touch aggregation is the second
side, touch cessation is in the middle; the past is one side, the future is the
second side, and the present is in the middle; pleasure is on one side,
suffering is the second side, and neither suffering nor pleasure is in the
middle; name is one side, form is the second side, consciousness is in the
middle; the six inner places are one side, and the six outer places are the
second side, and consciousness is in the middle; the body is one side, the body
aggregation is the second side, and the body disappears in the middle. After
consideration, it is called wisdom, which is knowing, understanding
...(omitted).

"Adhesion": There are two kinds of adhesion: the adhesion of craving and the
adhesion of seeing...; this is the adhesion of craving...; this is the adhesion
of seeing. What is craving adhesion? All boundaries, realms, scopes, borders,
are grasped, and are treated as one's own: this is mine, this is mine, so much
is mine, this area is mine; (my) form, sound, smell, taste, touch, things on the
ground, coats, maids and male servants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs,
elephants, cows and horses, mules, fields, homesteads, gold, coins, villages,
towns, capitals, places, treasuries, warehouses, all the land; because they are
craving and regard them as their own, all one-hundred-and-eight kinds of
craving. [AN.4.199] This is the adhesion of craving.

What is the adhesion of seeing? There are twenty people who rely on the body to
see, ten people who rely on the wrong view, and ten people who rely on the side
see, all the views, evil views, jungle (entangled) views, and desert (barren)
views like this. The grasping, acceptance, clinging, clinging to the view, the
distorted view, the wavering view, the bound view, the evil way, the evil
nature, the outside way, the clasping and inversion of the inversion
(vipariyesa) The grip of (viparīta), the grip of reversal (vipallāsa), the grip
of evil, the grip of "seeing the real in the unreal," all come to the sixty-two
evil views. This is the adhesion of seeing.

"After he knows on both sides, after consideration, he is not contaminated in
the middle": He is not contaminated after considering, after knowing, after
understanding, after weighing, after judging, after separating, after
clarifying; not tied, detached, released from bondage, he lives with a heart of
detachment and restraint.

"I said he is a 'great man'": This man is the highest person, the most
victorious person, the winner, the first person, the top person. I call him, I
say of him, I explain him, I speak about him.

Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "Great Virtue! Known as 'a man, a
great man,' Great Virtue! What makes one a great man?" "Sāriputta! I say that
those who are liberated are 'great men;' I say those who are not free are
'non-great-men.'

Sāriputta! How to be liberated? Sāriputta! Here, the bhikkhu lives in his own
body to observe the body, zeal, righteous knowledge, and mindfulness, and can
moderate the desire and worry about the world. When he lives in the body to
observe the body, the mind is free from defilements, and he is not clinging.
Freedom from all defilements; in feeling...(omitted) in the heart..., living in
the Dhamma and following the Dhamma, zealous, righteous, and mindful, can
moderate the craving and worry about the world. When he lives in the Dhamma and
follows the Dhamma, the mind is free from the defilements, and free from all
defilements it is without clinging. Sāriputta! In this way, the bhikkhu has a
liberated heart. Sāriputta! I say that those who are liberated are 'big men;' I
say those who are not liberated are 'non-big-men.'"

"He surpassed the tailor here": The tailor is called craving, which is greed,
thirst, ...(omitted), and unwholesome roots. For him, this tailor, whose thirst
is cut off, severed, calmed down, ceased, unable to arise, burned by the fire of
wisdom, he has surpassed, conquered the tailor, his desire for love, has passed,
has been crossed, has been overcome.

a disciple."
