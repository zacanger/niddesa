ground, coats, maids and male servants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs,
elephants, cows and horses, mules, fields, homesteads, gold, coins, villages,
towns, capitals, places, treasuries, warehouses, all the land; because they are

What is the adhesion of seeing? There are twenty people who rely on the body to
see, ten people who rely on the wrong view, and ten people who rely on the side

the middle": He is not contaminated after considering, after knowing, after

"I said he is a 'great man'": This man is the highest person, the most
victorious person, the winner, the first person, the top person. I call him, I
say of him, I explain him, I speak about him.

Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One: "Great Virtue! Known as 'a man, a
great man,' Great Virtue! What makes one a great man?" "Sāriputta! I say that
those who are liberated are 'great men;' I say those who are not free are
'non-great-men.'

Sāriputta! How to be liberated? Sāriputta! Here, the bhikkhu lives in his own
body to observe the body, zeal, righteous knowledge, and mindfulness, and can
moderate the desire and worry about the world. When he lives in the body to
observe the body, the mind is free from defilements, and he is not clinging.
Freedom from all defilements; in feeling...(omitted) in the heart..., living in
the Dhamma and following the Dhamma, zealous, righteous, and mindful, can
moderate the craving and worry about the world. When he lives in the Dhamma and
follows the Dhamma, the mind is free from the defilements, and free from all
defilements it is without clinging. Sāriputta! In this way, the bhikkhu has a
liberated heart. Sāriputta! I say that those who are liberated are 'big men;' I
say those who are not liberated are 'non-big-men.'"

"He surpassed the tailor here": The tailor is called craving, which is greed,
thirst, ...(omitted), and unwholesome roots. For him, this tailor, whose thirst

has been crossed, has been overcome.
