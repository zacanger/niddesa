### Fourth Chapter

> 151 &middot; In terms of taste, not being a greedy person,  
A person who is not desiring, a person who does not nurture others,  
A second-time beggar (not skipping houses), not restrained to any family,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"In terms of taste, one who is not greedy or desiring": "Taste," there are root,
branch, skin, leaf, flower, fruit, sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, alkaline,
astringent, pleasant, unpleasant, cold, and hot. Some Samaṇa and Brahman are
greedy for taste. They wander around for the best taste with their tongues.
After they get the sour taste, ask for no sour taste, and ask for sourness after
getting no sour taste; ...(omitted) sweetness ...(omitted); bitterness, spicy,
salty alkali; when they get the sour taste, they look for the astringency, when
they get the astringency, look for the sour taste; ...pleasant taste...,
unpleasant...; ...unpleasant..., pleasant...; When they get the heat, they ask
for coolness, they always ask for dissatisfaction (are dissatisfied?) after
getting the heat. They are greedy, craving, tied, fascinated, tainted, attached,
fixed, in the desire for taste. Being obstructed, for the single enlightened
person, the taste and thirst and love have been cut off, ..., therefore, that
single enlightened person eats food after inspection: "Neither for pleasure, nor
for intoxication, not for a good figure, not for dignity, but only for the
survival of this body, to stop harm, and to support the Brahma. In this way, I
will repel the previous feelings, will not arouse new feelings, be healthy,
without fault, and live in peace."

For example, if he applies oil to the sore, it is only for the purpose of
growing (flesh), or, if he applies oil to the axle, only for the purpose of
transporting goods, or, if he eats his son's meat it is only for the purpose of
passing through the desert. In the same way, the single-enlightened person ate
food after introspection: "Neither for pleasure....." I have separated from the
craving of taste, quit, departed, left, been freed, and being unbound, he lives
with an unrestrained heart.

"Those who are not greedy," greed is called craving, which is greed.... That
greed and thirst have been cut off for the Enlightened One, ..., therefore, the
single enlightened ones are the ones who are not greedy.

"Those who don't nurture other people, second-order beggars": "Those who don't
raise other people," For that single enlightened person, only nurture
themselves, not others.

"Those who do not nurture others, those who already know,  
Those who have been tamed, those who have settled in the core,  
Those who have exhausted their troubles and those who have eliminated their faults,  
I say he is a Brahman."  
[Ud.6]

"Those who do not nurture others, second-time beggars": The single enlightened
person puts on his clothes in the early afternoon, takes the mantle, has guarded
his body, has guarded his words, has guarded his heart, and his mind has
emerged, with the protection of the roots, in order to enter a village or town
with as a beggar, those who have their eyes down and behave adequately, go from
home to home without crossing to beg for alms.

"Do not be bound in the center of a family": the mind is bound in two ways:
making oneself humble, and others stand noble while the heart is bound, or
making others stand humble, and oneself stand noble and the heart is bound.
How to make yourself humble and make others stand up noble and flatter others?
...(omitted, see previous sections).

How to make others humble, make oneself stand noble and be restrained?
...(omitted, see previous sections).

"Do not be fettered in the center of one family": The mind of the single
enlightened person is not fettered by the obstacles of the family; the heart is
not fettered by the obstacles of the group (people); ...the residence; ...the
clothes; ...group feeding; ...shelter; ...patient's needs and medical
necessities.

> 152 &middot; After giving up the five covers of the mind,  
After expelling all the defilements,  
After cutting off love and aversion, independent,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Giving up the five covers of the mind": The one who is only enlightened, the
desire to obliterate, after giving up, after abandoning, after being driven
away, after finishing, after making it go to non-existence, malicious cover...,
sleeping cover..., regret cover..., doubt cover..., after giving up, after
abandoning up, after being driven away, after finishing, after making it go to
non-existence, after leaving desire, leaving unwholesome Dhamma, after entering
into the joy and happiness of the first jhāna, after separation.

"After having expelled all kilesas (impurities)": Greed is the heart that
follows the kilesas; anger is the heart that follows the kilesas; ignorance is
the heart that follows the kilesas; anger... resentment.... "After expelling all
the kilesas": After expelling all the kilesas, after removing, after
abandoning, after being expelled, after finishing, and making them go to

"The non-dependant one cuts off love and aversion": "The non-dependant" has two
kinds of dependence: the dependence of craving and the dependence of seeing....
"Love," there are two kinds of love: the love of thirsting and the love of
seeing.... "Aversion," that is the state of anger, hostility, disgust, aversion,

cuts off the love and the aversion": The thirsty love and the seeing love and
the aversion, to the single enlightened one, is cut off, severed, after
abandoning, after driving away, after finishing, making it come to

his heart toward (victory). He who has left, has departed, has been liberated,
has been separated from bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.

> 153 &middot; After putting aside happiness and suffering,  
And the joy and worry before (previously),  
After getting purity, peace, and calm,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"After putting aside happiness and suffering, and the joy and sorrow before":
The only enlightened one who renounced pleasure and sorrow, and with the
extinction of the joy and sorrow previously, enters and lives without suffering
or not suffering. Happiness is the fourth jhāna that starts from calm and
chanting all over.

"After gaining purity, peace, and calm": "calm," that is the peace,
carelessness, onlooking, the cessation of the mind, the equality of the mind,

    behaviors,  
Those who are firm, hardworking, with fortitude and strength,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Those whose vitality has been activated for the gain of the highest interest":
The highest interest is called immortality, Nibbāna, which is the cessation of
all actions, the cessation of all attachments, the extinction of craving, greed,
annihilation, Nibbāna. In order to obtain, receive, reach, contact, and testify
for the highest interests, live in the abandonment of unwholesome Dhamma, for
the fullness of good Dhamma and vitality has been activated, fortitude, firm
efforts, and not neglect the good Dhamma responsibility.

one who has only enlightened his desires hard, arouses vitality, devotes
himself, and works hard for the evil and unwholesome dhammas that have not

disappearing, increase, expansion, and completion of the practice of the good
Dhamma that has arisen, desire, hard work, vitality, dedication, diligence.

Or,  
"I am willing to leave only skin, tendons, and bones;  
If the flesh and blood of the body is dried up,  
As long as people's perseverance, human strength,  
Human vitality, and human efforts should (persist)  
But (the goal is) not achieved,  
There will be no cessation of vitality."  
[SN.12.2]

Nor go out of my residence,  
Will not cause the thigh to fall (lying down),  
While the arrow of thirst is not be removed."

building, the flat house, cave, hut, heavy pavilion, observation deck, round
house, shed, lecture hall, tent..., as long as my heart is not free from all
defilements without clinging, I will not go out from the tree."

"Just before this noon, I will obtain, fully obtain, attain, reach, and testify

night, the night, after the night, at the time of death, at the time of the

beings.

> 156 &middot; Those who wish for the extermination of love, those who do not let go,  
Those who are wise, those who learn more, those who have mindfulness,  
The perceiver, decider, and diligent one of the Dhamma  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Hope for the extinction of the thirst for love, the one who does not let go":
The thirst of "thirst for love" is the lust of..., the end of the death, the end
of ignorance, the end of interest, the end of rebirth, the end of rotation, the
end of some, the end of reincarnation, the end of the cycle, eager, and
supplicating.  "The one who does not let go," the one who is alone is a

responsibility, the one who doesn't let go.

has been heard, all those who have goodness in the beginning, goodness in the
middle, and goodness in the end; correct meaning and correct words, proclaiming
that there is only a complete and pure Brahman Dhamma. Such Dhamma has been
heard, remembered, recited, observed with the heart, and penetrated by seeing
the good. "Those who have mindfulness" are the one who is only enlightened, and

recallers who did it a long time ago and said it a long time ago.

"The Dhamma-seeker, the decider, and the diligent": The Dhamma-understander is

the single enlightened one, he is the realm enlightened person, the place
enlightened person, the interest enlightened person, the enlightened person of
the rebirth, the enlightened person of the revolving, some enlightened persons,
the enlightened person of rotation, the enlightened person of reincarnation. Or,
the one who is enlightened is the one who lives in the ultimate (boundary), the
one who lives in the world, the one who lives in the ultimate, the one who lives
in the ultimate place of interest, the one who lives in the final life, the one
who stands at the end of the incarnation, the one who stands at the end, the one
who stands at the end of reincarnation, the one who stands at the end of the
cycle, the one who stands at the end. Those who gather (the last body) at the
end, those who hold the last self-enlightenment.

"This is his last, this is the last gathering (body),  
The cycle of life and death, without his rebirth."

For this reason, the enlightened person is the perceiver of the Dhamma. The
"decider," the Four Holy Paths are called the decision, and the "one with the
Four Holy Paths" is the decider. He has reached, fully reached, arrived, and has
given testimony to the decision. The decision has been reached. "Diligence,"
