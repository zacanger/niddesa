### First Chapter

> 121 &middot; After putting down the rod against all living things,  
Hurting none of them,  
You shouldn't want a son, much less a companion;  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"After putting down the rod against all living things": "All things," all
completely, completely in every aspect, without surplus, and the whole, this is
the word of ubiquity, which is "everything." "Students" are called the weak and
the strong. The "cowards" belong to those who tremble and those who have not
been cut off in their thirst, as well as those who are terrified and afraid of
not being cut off. For what reason are they called the cowards? They tremble,
have fear, terror, come to fear, and for this reason they are called cowards.
"Strong ones" belong to those who have been cut off from trembling and thirst,
and those who have been cut off from fear and terror. For what reason are they
called the strong? They do not tremble, have fear, terror, or come to fear, and
for this reason they are called strong. "Rods," there are three types of rods:
body rods, speech rods, and mind rods. There are three types of rods for the
body, four types of rods for evil acts and three types of rods for evil
intentions.

"Hurting none of them": The life of each sentient being will not be injured by
clods, or sticks, or swords, or chains, or ropes. Do not use mud or sticks or
rods or swords or chains or ropes on any living beings.

"Should not want a son, much less other companions" "No" is negative. "Sons,"
there are four types of sons: sons born to oneself, sons born in the field,
adopted sons, and apprentices. "Companion," with whomever one has a happy
relationship, a happy coming, a happy communication, a happy standing, a happy
sitting, a happy lying, a happy talking, a happy conversation, a happy talking,
a happy interlocutor is called a companion. "You shouldn't want sons, much less
companions": A son, you shouldn't want, accept, hope, or pray for;
acquaintances, you shouldn't ....; or a close person, or a companion.

"One should walk alone like a rhinoceros": "Alone," the alone-enlightened person
is alone having become a bhikkhu, alone in the righteousness without a partner,
alone in the righteousness of the thirst for love, "always free from greed" is
alone, "always free from anger" is alone, "always free from delusion" is alone,
"always free from defilement" is alone, "having passed the road without forks"
is alone, "already realized the highest self-enlightenment" is alone.

How is that alone-enlightened person alone having become a bhikkhu? After the
alone-enlightened person cut off all obstacles to home, after cutting off the
obstacles of children and wife, ...of relatives, ...of friends, of storage,
shaves off his hair, after being wrapped in robes, he went from being a bhikkhu
at home to a non-house life, and after entering a state of nothingness, he
walked, lived, moved, went on, guarded, and survived.

How is it that the alone-enlightened person who is alone without a partner? When
he was such a bhikkhu, he was alone in the woods, wild forests, and border
dwellings (sitting places): quiet, away from the atmosphere, living alone,
suitable for sitting alone; he would walk alone, stand alone, sit alone, lie
alone, enter the village alone for alms, go forward alone, return alone, sit
alone in a quiet place, perform alone, walk alone, live, move, go on, guard, and
survive alone.

How is the alone-enlightened person in the thirst for love and righteousness as
alone? He is so alone and without a partner, he should live in reluctance, zeal,
self-effort, great diligence, and diligence, after destroying the demon
accompanied by the army, the evil demon, the relatives of the liberated, the
net, the strong mobile, abandoning the entangled thirsty love, driving away,
making to end, making it go to non-existence.

"People who have thirsty love as their partner,  
Reincarnate for a long time,  
Become such a state, other states,  
Do not go beyond reincarnation.  
Knowing this type of trouble:  
Craving is the origin of suffering,  
Departing from thirsty love, without taking,  
Bhikkhus should march mindfully."  
[It.15/Sn.3.12,745-746]

How can the one who is alone in enlightenment consider always free from greed as
alone? "Take one of the states of greed to renounce greed" as being alone, to
renounce greed in one of the states is aloneness, one of the states of
renunciation of ignorance is to be alone, and one of the state of renunciation
of ignorance is to be alone.

How is that alone-enlightened person has crossed the road without fork as alone?
The path without a fork is called the four mindfulnesses, the four
righteousnesses, the four divine bases, the five senses, the five powers, the
seven enlightenment factors, and the eight sacred paths.

"The one who sees the death of life (rebirth), the compassionate one,  
Who knows the way without forks,  
Using this way, they crossed torrents in the past,  
Will cross (in the future), and are (crossing) in the present."  
[SN.47.18]

How is that alone-enlightened person has been enlightened alone, the supreme
independent enlightenment as alone? Enlightenment is called wisdom, root of
wisdom, power of wisdom, investigation, vipassanā, and right view in the four
realms. The one who is enlightened independently by the way, enlightened by the
Path, and enlightened with the wisdom, alone, feels that "all actions are
impermanent," that "all actions are suffering," that "all dhammas are selfless,"
that "knowledge is dependent on deeds," that "knowledge is a dependency for name
and form," that "touch is based on six sense bases," that "feeling is based on
touch," "feeling is a dependency for thirst for love," "thirst and love ...for
grasping;" "grasping ...for existence," " existence (becoming) ...for birth,"
"birth ...for old age and death;" "the extinguishment of ignorance"..., of
formation, ...of consciousness, ...of name and form..., (omitted);" "this is
suffering," ..."this is the collection of suffering," "this is the extinguishing
of suffering," this is the path leading to suffering, "these are troubles,"
"this is the collection of troubles," "this is the path leading to troubles,"
"these dhammas should be known," "these dhammas should be cut off," "these
dhammas should be testified to," "these dhammas should be practiced;" felt the
gathering, destruction, pleasure, trouble, and renunciation of the six touches;
the gathering of the abundance...; the gathering of perception, the extinction,
the pleasure, the trouble, and the renunciation.

Or, where (any) should be felt, should be conscious, should be awakened, should
be enlightened, should be proven, should be touched, should be testified,
everything is subject to that alone, awareness, awakening, enlightenment,
attainment, touch (contact), and testimony. In this way, the one who has been
enlightened alone is alone.

"Should do," there are eight types of behaviors: prestige behaviors, conduct
behaviors, mindful behaviors, fixed behaviors, wisdom behaviors, Path, reaching,
and world benefits. "Behavior" is about the four behaviors, "walking" is about
the six inner and outer regions, "mindfulness" is about the four mindfulnesses,
"meditation" is about the four types of jhāna, and "wisdom" is about the four
noble truths. "The Path" refers to the Four Noble Ways, "reaching" refers to the
Four Samaṇa Fruits, and "world benefits" refers to the Tathāgata, Arahants,
fully enlightened ones, alone-enlightened ones, and disciples. The act of
conduct belong to those who have sufficient vows, behavior belongs to those who
guard the roots, mindfulness and behavior belong to those who do not let go,
fixed behavior belongs to those who strive to increase the mind, and wisdom and
behavior belong to those who have enough. For those who do, the Path belongs to
the righteous person, the attainment action belongs to the attained person, and
the world-benefit actions belong to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Enlightened
One, and the disciples of the Enlightened One.

The next eight types of behavior: the victorious (who overcome the problems)
will act with faith, those who strive with vitality will act with their
vitality, those who make it appear will act with mindfulness, those who
establish (do) do not distract will act with determination, those who know will
act with wisdom, the one who knows to walk with the act of knowledge, In this
way, the one who walks in the way makes all the good dhamma survive. "Walking in
order to walk," in this way those who walk the way reach excellence.

The next eight types of behavior: the seeing behavior of the righteous person,
the (heart-)oriented behavior of the righteous person, the taking and receiving
behavior of the righteous person, the innocent behavior of the righteous person,
the hard working behavior of the righteous person, the present action of the
mindful person, the non-scattering action of the right minded person [Ps.1,12].

"Like a rhinoceros," the rhinoceros is truly unique. In the same way, the one
who is enlightened alone is like that one, equivalent to that one, and
contrasting to that one. If it is too salty, it is called salty, if it is too
bitter, it is called bitterness, if it is too sweet, it is called like honey, if
it is too hot, it is called like fire, if it is too cold, it is called like ice,
and disciples who reach great supernatural power are called as a master.
Similarly, the alone-enlightened person is there like that one, equal to that,
contrasted to that, alone without partner (no duality), free from bondage, and
he walks, lives, and acts correctly in the world, guards, makes survival.

> 122 &middot; From connections formed arises love (affection),  
And from love arises suffering,  
Watching the trouble arising from affection,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"The connection that arises generates love": "Connection," there are two types
of connection: the connection of seeing and the connection of hearing. What is
the connection of seeing? Here, a certain type of people see the upright,
beautiful, and beloved women and girls with the most beautiful face like a
lotus. After seeing them, they mentally arise (thoughts of): "Hair, or a
beautiful face, or good eyes, or good ears, ...nose, lips, teeth, mouth, neck,
breasts, chest, abdomen, waist, thigh, calf, palm, sole, finger, nail, etc., all
beautiful and good." After seeing, rejoicing, welcoming, hoping, making it
arise, following the bondage of greed, this is the connection of seeing.

What is the connection of hearing? Here, a certain type of people heard: "In a
village or town with a name like that, there are women or girls who are upright,
beautiful, and beloved, with the most beautiful face like a lotus." After
hearing it, they were happy, welcome, and hopeful, making it arise, following
the bondage of greed, this is the connection of hearing.

"Love," there are two types of love: the love of thirsting and the love of
seeing (views). What is love of love? All are called boundaries, realms, scopes,
borders, grasped, and regarded as one's own: this is mine, this is mine, so many
are mine, this area is mine; (my) form, sound, smell, taste, touch, things
spread on the ground, coats, maids and male servants, goats and sheep, chickens
and pigs, elephants, cows and horses, mules, fields, homesteads, gold, gold
coins, villages, towns, capitals, places, treasuries, warehouses, all the land,
because they are thirsty and regard them as their own, all one-hundred-and-eight
thirsty trends [AN.4.199]; this is the love of love.

What is the love of seeing (views)? There are twenty views of the body, ten evil
views, ten side views, all views like this, evil views, jungle (entangled)
views, desert (barren) views, distorted views, shaken views, clinging,
acceptance, holding, clinging to the bound view, the place where the evil way,
the evil nature, the outside way depend, the clasping of the inversion
(vipariyesa), the clinging of the inversion (viparīta), the inversion
(vipallāsa), the grip of evil, the grip of "(seeing) the real in the unreal,"
all come to the reach of the sixty-two evil views, this is the love of seeing.

"From the connection arises love": The love that craves and the love that sees
are generated, arise, are born, are produced, and appear with the connection of
seeing and the connection of hearing.

"The suffering of love arises": "Love," there are two types of love....
"Suffering arises." Here, a certain type of person practices evil deeds of the
body, evil deeds in word, and evil deeds in intention. He kills, takes without
giving, invades others, takes prey (loots), blocks roads, robs, and abducts
wives. Speaking vainly, after he was captured, they went to see the king: "Your
Majesty! This is a thief, a criminal, let you punish this (with a) sentence."
The king rebuked him, and he took blame for it, causing terror to arise, he,
feeling suffering, sorrow, where does this horror, suffering, and sorrow arise?
It arises from his love, happiness, greed, joy and greed.

The king was not satisfied with this situation. The king imprisoned him with
handcuffs, or with ropes, or with fetters, or with vines, or with kudzu vines,
or by throwing into chains, or by fences, or by binding to the village, town,
city, country, or to the place, and it is even declared: "You must not walk away
from here." He also feels suffering and sorrow by the bondage; where does this
horror, suffering, and sorrow arise? It arises from his love, happiness, greed,
joy and greed.

The king is not satisfied with this situation. The king will transport his
property from him: hundreds or thousands or one hundred thousand (money). He
also feels suffering and sorrow due to the loss of property....

The king was not satisfied with this situation. The king imposed various
penalties on him: whipping, beating with a stick, beating with a cane, cutting
off hands, feet, hands and feet, ears, nose, ears and nose, and imposing sour
porridge pot punishment, shell-bald punishment, Rāhu's mouth punishment, fire
torture, candle hand punishment, exorcism, bark clothing punishment, antelope
punishment, hook flesh punishment, money punishment, alkaline bath punishment,
twisted door lock punishment, straw foot pedal punishment, drenching with hot
oil, making the dog bite, making a piercing while alive, beheading with a sword;
he also feels suffering and sorrow due to punishment.... The king is the master
of these four types of staff (rod punishment).

With their own work and the disintegration of their body, they were reborn in
the world of suffering, evil, lower world, and hell after death. The jailers
imposed five types of punishment on him: they made the red hot iron rod pass
through the (first) palm, and they made the red hot iron rod pass through the
(second) palm. After the second palm, they passed the red hot iron rod through
the (first) sole of the foot, they passed the red hot iron rod through the
second sole of the foot, and they passed the red hot iron rod through the chest
in the middle. He felt bitter, fierce, violent, [MN.129], pungent feelings, and
he would not die until the evil kamma was eliminated. Where did this terror,
suffering, and sorrow arise? ....

After the jailers lay him down, they cut him with an axe... (omitted) after the
jailers grabbed him under their feet, they cut him with a small axe..., the
jailers harnessed him on the cart and set him on fire, so he was ignited in a
burning, glorious fire, ..., the jailers made him climb up and down the burning,
shining charcoal volcano..., after the jailers caught him up and down, they
threw them into the hot, blazing, burning, red-glowing copper pot; he was boiled
with foam there, and he rose up once, sunk once, and moved across once. He felt
bitter.... (Where did this terror, suffering, and sorrow arise? .... The jailers
threw him into the great hell, and in the great hell:

"There are four doors in the four corners, divided into equal parts,  
Surrounded by iron walls, and the top is covered by iron.  
The earth is made of iron, and it shines with the burning of fire,  
All around for a hundred yojanas, always pervading and abiding.  
The miserable burning is terrible, the brilliant flames are hard to approach,  
Hair visibly standing on end due to the horror of suffering.  
From the east wall, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the west.  
From the west wall, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the east.  
From the north wall, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the south.  
From the south wall, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the north.  
From below, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the roof.  
From above, a mass of fire originates,  
Burning those with evil kamma, striking against the ground.  
Blazing iron, sorrow like being burned,  
Just so this great hell is seen from above and below.  
There beings are very cruel, those who have done great crimes,  
Perpetual evildoers, tortured without dying.  
The body is like fire, that of the dweller in this hell,  
The one with steady kamma, the fire has neither ashes nor soot.  
They run to the east, and from there to the west;  
The run to the north, and from there to the south;  
Everywhere they run, the doors are shut,  
The want to go forth, they seek for release.  
They can't go forth from there, they obtain this by means of kamma,  
For those evildoers, their abundant kamma is not yet fully ripe."

Where did this terror, suffering, and sorrow arise? It arises from his love,
happiness, greed, joy and greed.

Again, all the suffering of hell, the suffering of the animal world, the
suffering of the hungry ghost world, the suffering of humans, where those are
arising, where are they produced, where did it happen, where was born, where did
it appear, be arisen? It is produced, arises, is born, is generated, arises with
his love as a condition, happiness as condition, greed as condition, joy and
greed as condition.

"Watching the troubles of love": "Love," .... "Watching the troubles of love":
The troubles of the love of love and the love of seeing, he watched, saw,
contemplated, and observed.

> 123 &middot; Those who pity friends and confidantes,  
With the heart bound (attached), lose their own interests,  
Watching this danger in intimate interaction,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Pity for friends and confidantes will cause you to lose your own interests and
be constrained": "Friends," there are two types of friends: friends at home and
friends (away) from home (monastics). What is a friend at home? Here, a certain
category of people give what is hard to give, charity, do what is hard to do,
forgive (tolerate) what is hard to forgive, he tells (you his) secret, keeps
(your) secret, and never forsakes you in disasters, he is the one who would give
his life for (you) [DN.31], he does not contempt when (you) are exhausted, this
is a friend at home.

What is a friend (away) from home (monastic)? Here, the bhikkhu is lovable,
agreeable, respectable, admirable, an interpreter, tolerant of other people's
words, and an esoteric talker (leader). He does not encourage [AN.7.37] and
persuade on non-increasing precepts. He persuades him in the four-mindfulness
practice effort, in ...(omitted) the eight sacred paths of practice, this is a
'friend (away) from home.'

Those with whom one is happy to go, happy to come (, happy to come and go),
happy to stand, happy to sit, happy lying, happy talking, happy conversation,
happy talk, happy interlocutors are called a confidant.

"Pity a friend, a confidant; lose in your own interest." A friend, a confidant,
an acquaintance, a close person, a companion, a considerer, a sorrower,
abandoning his interests, the interests of others, and the interests of both,
also abandoning the interests of the present life and the interests of the next
life also causes the highest interests to retreat, forcefully retreat, be lost,
avoided, and eliminated; those who have pity for friends and confidants, he
makes the interests retreat.

"The heart is bound," the heart is bound in two ways: (by) making oneself stand
in lowliness, (and) making others stand in nobility while the heart is
restrained; or (by) making others stand in lowliness, (and) making oneself stand
in nobleness and the heart is restrained. How to make yourself humble and make
others stand up noble and flatter others? (Thinking:) "You are very helpful to
me, I rely on you to get clothes, food, shelter, the needs of patients, medical
necessities, and anyone who gives or wants to do they think I am dependent on
you, those who are regarded as you, all my previous names from my parents have
disappeared to me, because you are known as those who frequent (someone's) home
like that; those who often visit (someone's) home." This is to make oneself
humble, to make others stand noble, and their hearts are bound.

How to make others humble and make oneself stand noble and be restrained?
(Thinking:) "I am a good person to you. Because of me, you turn to the Buddha,
to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha, become (as) those who are free from killing,
those who have not given and take, those who have not given, and those who are
free from lying, and those who (do not) drink spirits, fruit wine, and wine, I
will give you instructions, give me a lot of questions, I will explain uposatha,
and build temples. However, after you abandon me, you respect, honor, and revere
other people." This is to make others humble, and make oneself stand noble, and
the heart is bound. For those who pity for friends and confidants, their
interests are lost and the heart is bound.

"Watching the horror in intimate communication (interaction)": "Horror," the
horror of life, the horror of old age, ...sickness, ...death, kings, thieves,
fire, water, self-reprimand, horror, others, sticks, waves, the dragon,
whirlpool, crocodile [AN.4.122], livelihood, of dishonor, timidity, of
intoxication, evil interest in the group is the horror of horrible stiffness,
body hair standing on end, and fear of heart worry. "In intimate communication
(interaction)," There are two types of intimate communication: of love and of
seeing.... "Watching this horror in intimate communication": This horror in
intimate communication is watched, seen, and observed.

> 124 &middot; Like a huge bamboo (tree) becomes entangled together,  
Is one who has care for his children and wives,  
Like a bamboo shoot that is not stuck,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Like a huge bamboo being entangled together": Bamboo is called a bamboo bush.
In the bamboo bush, old bamboo is stuck, entangled, attached, fixed, and
obstructed. The same is true; being entangled together is called craving, it is
greed, lust, acquiescence, conformity, joy, liking, wanting, desire,
fascination, taking, great greed, being tied, sludge, disturbance, hypocrisy,

love; "it seizes" is love; "fraud" is love; "poisonous root" is love; "poisonous

aggregate existence, the four aggregates, five aggregates, past, future,
present, ...enlarged attachments to the dhammas that can be seen, heard, felt,
and can be known.

"Anyone who is concerned with children and wives": "Children (sons)," there are
four types of sons: .... The wife is called the one who should be supported.
Attention is called craving, which is greed, ....

"Like a bamboo shoot that is not stuck": Bamboo is called a bamboo bush. For
example, the young top buds (shoots) in the bamboo bush are not stuck, attached,
tied, or obstructed, and they have gone out and are not obstructed, leaving,
having become free. In the same way... "Being stuck (attachment)," there are two
types of adhesion: ...; ...not to be stuck, not caught, not captured, not bound
by the world, not tied, separated, left, liberated, detached, not attached to,
not caught, not bound, leaving bondage, he lives with a restrained hear.

> 125 &middot; As an unbound deer walks in the forest,  
Walks to the desired pasture,  
A wise person, watching (his) freedom,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"An unbound deer walks in the forest, walking to the desired pasture": "Deer,"
there are two types of deer: the deer and the spotted deer. For example, the
deer living in the woods is walking in the woods and forests, walking at ease,
standing at ease, sitting at ease, and lying down at ease.

This was said by the Blessed One [MN.25]: "Bhikkhus! Just like a deer living in
the woods, when walking in the woods and forests, walk with peace of mind,
stand, sit, and lie with peace of mind. What is the reason? Bhikkhus! That is an
area inaccessible to brutal men.

Similarly, bhikkhus! Here, the bhikkhus live in the first jhāna of reasoning and
waiting after entering from renunciation from desire and unwholesome dhamma, and
happiness and joy after detachment, bhikkhus! This is called the bhikkhu making
the demon blind. After killing the demon's eyes, the demon enters a state of not
seeing and footlessness (misfortune).

Besides, bhikkhus! Bhikkhus calm down with reasoning and thinking, confident,
and one-minded. After entering, they live in the second jhāna of no reasoning or
thinking, and concentration produces joy and happiness, bhikkhus! This is called
the bhikkhu making the demon blind. After killing the demon's eyes, ....

Besides, bhikkhus! The bhikkhu fades away with joy and lives in peace, has
mindfulness, right knowledge, and feels happiness with the body. After entering,
he lives in the third jhāna of this holy disciple proclaiming: 'He is a calm,
mindful, and happy one,' Bhikkhus! This is called the bhikkhu making the demon
blind. After killing the demon's eyes, ....

Besides, bhikkhus! After entering the fourth jhāna, the bhikkhus live in the fourth
jhāna that is not painful or unhappy, after entering the fourth jhāna, bhikkhus!
This is called the bhikkhu making the demon blind. ....

Besides, bhikkhus! Bhikkhus transcend all lusts and thoughts, with the extinction
of opposing thoughts, without thinking about all types of thoughts, (and know):
'Void is boundless,' after entering, live in the boundless void, bhikkhus! This is
called the bhikkhu making the demon blind. ....

Besides, bhikkhus! After Bhikkhu transcends all emptiness and boundlessness (and
knowledge): 'Consciousness is boundless,' after entering, live in the
boundlessness of consciousness... (omitted).

Besides, bhikkhus! (A Bhikkhu,) after surpassing all the boundless places of
consciousness (and knowing): 'There is nothing,' after entering, live in
nowhere....

Besides, bhikkhus! (A Bhikkhu,) after surpassing everything that has no possessions,
after entering, he will live in a place where he wants to be....

Besides, bhikkhus! (A Bhikkhu,) after surpassing all non-thinking things, after
entering, staying in wanting to be destroyed, after seeing with wisdom, all his
troubles are destroyed, bhikkhus! This is called the Bhikkhu blinding the demon.
After killing the demon's eyes, the demon enters a state of not seeing and
footlessness, letting go of his attachment to the world. He walks with peace of
mind, stands with peace of mind, sits with peace of mind, and lies with peace of
mind. What is the reason? Bhikkhu is an unreachable area for the demon."

"Wise men watch freedom": "Wise men" are wise people, enlightened people, and
distinguished people. "Humans" are sentient beings, human beings, student
Brāhmaṇas, humans, individuals, beings, those who have birth, those born to
Indā, and Manu. "Free," there are two types of freedom: free in Dhamma and free
as a man. What is free in Dhamma? Four mindfulnesses, four righteousnesses....
This is the freedom of Dhamma. What is a free man? Anyone who possesses these
freedoms is called a free man. "The wise men watch freedom": The wise people
watch, see, and observe the freedom of Dhamma.

> 126 &middot; One is addressed among companions  
At home, standing, walking, or traveling,  
Watching for the freedom that is not desired,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"He is addressed among his companions, when staying at home, standing, walking,
traveling": wherever he is happy, (with whom he is) happy to come, happy to go
with, happy to stand, happy to sit, happy to sleep, happy for good talk,
pleasant talk, and pleasant conversation, are called companions. "He is
addressed among his companions, when staying at home, standing, walking, and
traveling": When staying at home, standing, walking, and traveling among his
companions, he considers his own interests, the interests of others, and both
interests, consider the interests of the current life, the interests of the
afterlife, and the interests of both.

"Watching the freedom not to be desired": For the fool, the unkind, the
outsider, and the sectarian disciples, this is undesirable, that is: to be bald
and robe-clothed; for the supporter of the Buddha (an independent person), this
is what is desired, that is, becoming bald and robe-clothed. "Free" has two
types of freedom: .... "Watching the freedom not to be desired": Watch, see,
contemplate, and observe the freedom of the Dhamma.

> 127 &middot; There is entertainment and joy among companions,  
And great love for sons.

How is "inhabiting there" danger? There, these evil and unwholesome dhammas
arose to restrain individuals, such as burrowing animals lying in caves; aquatic
animals lying in water; forest animals lying in the forest; arboreal animals
lying in trees. In the same way, these evil and unwholesome dhammas give rise to
mutual dependence.

This was said by the Blessed One [SN.35.151]: "Bhikkhus! Bhikkhus with apprentices
and masters live in misery and restlessness. But, bhikkhus! How is it that bhikkhus
with disciples and masters live in distress and restlessness?

Bhikkhus! Here, after seeing the form with his eyes, the bhikkhu has the
memories and intentions of those evil and unwholesome Dhamma that follow the
knot. They live in him; evil and unwholesome dhammas live and enter (occupy).
Therefore, he is called 'having disciples.' They conquer him; evil and
unwholesome dhammas conquer him. Therefore, he is called 'the master.'

Besides, bhikkhus! After the bhikkhu hears the sound with his ears...(omitted),

internal grievances. Bhikkhus! Greed is internal grime, internal non-friends,
...; Bhikkhus! Sorrow...; Bhikkhus! Infatuation.... Bhikkhus! These are the three
types of internal grime, internal non-friends, internal enemies, internal
killers, and internal grievances."

"Greed is the cause of no benefit, and greed is the one which shakes the heart,  
Horror arises from it, and people don't realize (understand) it.  
The greedy person does not know the benefits, the greedy person cannot see the Dhamma,  
At that time he was a blind dark one: anyone who can conquer with greed.  
Anger is the cause of no benefit, anger is the one that shakes the heart,  
horror arises from it, and people don't realize it.  
The angry do not know the benefits, the angry cannot see the Dhamma,  
At that time he was a blind dark one: a man who can (be) conquered.  
Foolishness is the cause of no benefit, foolishness is the one that shakes the heart,  
horror arises from it, and people don't realize it.  
Fools don't know the benefits, fools can't see the Dhamma,

a person arise, disadvantage, suffering, and restlessness arise. Which three are
there? King! When the greed within the man himself arises, disadvantages,
sufferings, and restlessness arise; King! When the aggression within the man
himself arises.... King! When the foolishness within the person arises, ...."

"A greedy, aversive, foolish, malevolent man,  
Hurts oneself, like many fruits (damage) a tree's heart."

This was said by the Blessed One: [SN.10.3]

Unhappiness, happiness, and horror (lit. body hair standing on end);  
From here is where intention arises,  
Like a little boy letting a crow go."

overwhelmer, the terminator, the renegade. "The one who is not frightened," the
one who is alone-enlightened is the one who is not timid, not frightened, not
afeared, and does not run away. He dwells in having given up fear of fear and
(giving up) his body hair standing on end.

People like this can be called a hero."

confusion (and say): 'My rise is empty, and my efforts are fruitless.' Bhikkhus!
This is called the fault of desire....

Bhikkhus! If a virtuous man gets wealth by rising up and working hard, he will
feel pain and worry in order to protect that wealth: 'How can (I make it so)
neither the king take my wealth, nor the thieves will take it, nor the fire will
burn it out, nor water flow (it) away, nor will the unlovable heirs take it
away?' When he guards and protects those wealth, or the king takes it, or the
thieves take it, or the fire burns, or the water runs (it) away, or the

with desire; Bhikkhus! 'Suffering,' this is synonymous with desire;
...disease..., ...tumor..., the stab of an arrow, staining, mud (quagmire),
mother fetus (being born or reborn).... Why is 'terror' synonymous with desire?
Bhikkhus! Because those who are infected and bound by desire and greed ill not
be free from terror in their lives, and in the next life, they will not be free
from terror. Therefore, 'terror' is synonymous with desire. Bhikkhus! Why is
'suffering'... 'disease'.... Bhikkhus! Because those who are tainted and bound
by desire and greed will not are not free from the mother's womb in (this) life,
and will not be free from the mother's womb in the next life, therefore, this is
a synonym for desire."

"Terror, suffering, disease, tumors,  
Piercing arrows and infection, the quagmire and the fetus,  
These are called desires, where most people are attached.  
They fell into a desirable state, then walked into the mother's womb,  
When a bhikkhu becomes a zealous person, he does not give up right knowledge.  
He conquered this obstacle and road like that,  
He observes these trembling people: those who have life and death."

"After seeing this horror in all types of desires," After seeing this horror in
all types of desires, he saw, after seeing, after weighing....

> 138 &middot; Heat and cold, hunger and thirst,  
And the wind, sun, fly, and snake,  
After enduring all this,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Heat, cold, hunger and thirst": "cold," there is cold due to two reasons: cold
due to inner excitement, or cold due to external weather. "Heat," hot due to two
reasons: .... Hunger is called hunger. Thirst is called the desire for water.

"And the wind, sun, fly, and snake": "Wind," east wind, west wind, north wind,
south wind, dusty wind, dust-free wind, cold wind, hot wind, breeze, gale, fast
wind [SN.17.9], side wind, golden-winged bird wind, palm leaf wind, fan wind.
The scorching sun is called the torment (scorching heat) of the sun. The fly
(horsefly) is called the fly (gadfly). The snake (crawler) is called the snake.

"After enduring all this": After he has defeated, overwhelmed, finished,
crushed.

> 139 &middot; As an elephant which up the herd,  
With a back like a lotus (spotted), outstanding,  
Will live in the forest as he likes,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Like an elephant (nāga; also meaning a noble person) after giving up the herd":
The elephant is called the elephant, and the one who is enlightened alone is
also the elephant. For what reason is the alone-enlightened person an elephant?
"Don't commit a crime" is the elephant; "don't go" is the elephant; "don't come"
is the elephant. How is the alone-enlightened person "not committing crimes" as
an elephant? Crimes are called evil and unwholesome dhammas: those that are
polluted, that there are again (re-existing), there are fears, those that suffer
the consequences, and the ones that will die in the future.

"Do not commit any crimes in the world,  
After leaving all bonds and bondages,  
Those who don't stick to everything and are free,  
Like this are truly called elephants."

How is the alone-enlightened person "not going" as an elephant? The one
enlightened one shouldn't do what he doesn't want to do; what he doesn't want to
do is not what he should do; he who doesn't go because of obsession should not
do what he should; don't go with anger; don't go because of ignorance; don't go
because of conceit; don't go because of seeing; don't go because of abandonment;
don't go because of doubt; don't go because of potential troubles; don't be
carried by quarrels, taken away, and moved.

How is the alone-enlightened person "not coming" as elephant? Any pollution that
is cut off by the Sotāpanna Path, those pollution he no longer experiences, does
not return, and does not go back; it is said that... (omitted) is not
returned... (omitted); all that pollution is cut off by the Arahant Path, he
will no longer experience, return, or go back to those pollutions.

"Like an elephant after abandoning the herd": For example, after the elephant
gives up and avoids the herd, it enters the woods, walks, lives, moves, goes on,
guards, and survives. Those who are alone in enlightenment also give up and
avoid the masses, and then they use the woods, wild forests, and border
dwellings (sitting places): low-noise, quiet, isolated atmosphere, alone,
suitable for sitting alone; he walks alone, stands alone, sits alone, lies
alone, enters the village alone for alms, advances alone, returns alone, sits
alone in a quiet place, performs alone, walks, lives alone, acts, goes on,
guards, and survives.

"The back is as the lotus flower, and outstanding": As the back of the elephant
has seven treasures or eight treasures, the one who is alone-enlightened has no
precept and prohibition learning accumulation, no concentration learning
accumulation, no wisdom learning accumulation, no liberation learning
accumulation, no perfect learning accumulation,; like the elephant with a lotus,
the one who is alone-enlightened also uses the flower of the seven branches of
enlightenment as the one with the lotus: mind as the flower of enlightenment,
the flower of enlightenment by choosing the Dhamma, ...with energy, ...with
happiness, tranquility, calmness. Like that. The head elephant is outstanding
with power (fortitude), with strength, with speed, and with courage. The one who
is alone with enlightenment is also such with precepts, with concentration, with
wisdom, with liberation, and liberation with wisdom.

"Will live in the wild (forest) as he likes": As the elephant lives in the wild
as he likes, so the Enlightened One lives in the wild as he likes: to live in
the wild as he likes in the first jhāna; also with the second jhāna...
(omitted), also with the third jhāna..., and also with the fourth jhāna, to live
in the woods as he likes; also with compassion..., relief..., joy, peace of mind
to live in the woods as he likes; also to dwell in the boundless void, ...the
boundlessness of knowledge, ...nothingness, wait for extinction, for Fruit, to
live in the woods as you like.

> 140 &middot; It is impossible that those who are willing to meet (have company)  
Can reach (even) temporary relief,  
After listening to the words of (him of) the Sun tribe,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"It's impossible that those who are willing to meet (have company) can reach
(even) temporary relief": This is said by the Blessed One [MN.122]: "Ānanda,
indeed, everyone who is happy to have company, is better for having company,
likes to have company, specializes and enjoys gatherings, bhikkhus who are
better for gatherings and get joy in the gatherings will be those who are
free-willed, those who are not difficult, and those who do not have
difficulties, such as vitality, solitary, quiet, and enlightenment — this is
impossible. But, Ānanda, whichever bhikkhu lives alone, away from the group,
this should be expected: such a bhikkhu will be happy, lonely, quiet,
enlightened, etc. That type of enjoyment, those who have no difficulty — this is
possible. Ānanda, indeed, everyone who enjoys gatherings, ...will enter and
dwell in an appeased, calmed, unshakable heart — this is impossible. But Ānanda,
whichever bhikkhus live alone and away from groups..., this should be expected:
such a bhikkhu will live in an appeased, calmed, unshakable heart — this is
possible."

"After listening to the words of the Sun tribe": The sun (ādicco) is called the
sun (sūriyo), his surname is Gotama, and the one who is enlightened is also the
surname of Gotama, and the one who is enlightened is a relative of the surname
of the sun and has kinship, so that alone-enlightened person is from the Sun
Clan. "After listening to the words of the Sun tribe": The words, ways of
speaking, teachings, explanations, admonitions of the Sun tribe, after hearing,
after grasping, understanding, and discerning.

### Third Chapter

> 141 &middot; "The distorted view has been cast off,  
The decision has been reached, the way has been obtained,  
I have arisen knowledge and will not be guided by others":  
So saying, one should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"The distorted view has been cast off": The distorted view is called the Twenty
Dependent Views. Here, the ordinary people who have not heard of the Holy One,
have never seen the saints, those who are not proficient in the Dhamma, and have
not been trained in the Dhamma; they have never seen the Dhamma of good people,
are unskilled in the Dhamma, and have not been trained in the good Dhamma. They
think that form is self, or 'I' have form, or form is in 'me,' or 'I' am in
form, ...feeling..., ...thinking..., ...consciousness... [SN.22.1]; these are
distorted views. "The distorted view has been shaken off": The distorted view
has been shaken off, has been surpassed, has been traversed, has been
transcended, has been overcome.

"The decision has been reached, the way has been obtained": The four (holy) ways
(Paths) are called decisions. Those who possess the four noble paths have
reached, fully reached, and decision that has been reached. "The path has been
obtained," He has gained the Path, has obtained the Path, has reached the Path,
has witnessed the Path.

"I am the one who has arisen wisdom and will not be guided by other people": The
wisdom of the one who has been enlightened has arisen, has been fully arisen,
has been born, has been produced, has appeared: "All actions are impermanent"
has arisen... (omitted), "all deeds are suffering"..., "all dhammas are without
self"..., "any collection of dhammas is an extinction"...."Won't be guided by
other people," that alone-enlightened person is one who is not guided by others,
does not depend on others, does not rely on others, has arrived to not being
bound by others, he knows and sees truthfully, is not ignorant, the right
knower, and the rememberer: "All actions are impermanent," he is a person who is
not guided by others...(omitted)....

> 142 &middot; Those who do not have greed, deceit, or desire,  
Those who do not hide evil, those who have eliminated evil and delusions,  
After becoming one who has left his wishes in all the world,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Those who are not greedy, who are not deceitful, and those who are not
craving": Greed is called craving, that is greed, lust, acquiescence,
conformity, joy, desire, obsession, taking, contaminated, disturbance, fraud,
(reincarnation) root cause, (bitter) fertility, tailoring (greed), net, river,
bondage, rope, attachment, accumulation, companionship, desire, intimate
interaction, forest, jungle, love, expectation, relationship, desire for form,
desire for sounds, desire for smells, desire for tastes, desire for touches,
desire for acquisition, desire for wealth, desire for sons, desire for life, the
state of desire, hope, prayer, greedy appearance, possessing greed, inquiring
for profit, illegal greed, improper greed, hope, envy, desire for desire, desire
for nothingness, desire for form, formless thirst, extinguished thirst, form
thirst, sound thirst, smell thirst, taste thirst, touch thirst, dhamma thirst,
torrent, harness, binding, clinging, obstacles, covering, defilements, potential
trends of troubles, entanglement, vines, stinginess, suffering roots, causes of
suffering, occurrence of suffering, magical nets, magical hooks, magical food,
the realm of the devil, the residence of the devil, the state of the devil, the
bondage of the devil, the river of thirst, the net of thirst, the rope of
thirst, the sea of thirst, craving, greed, and the root of unwholesomeness. That
greed, craving, for the alone-enlightened person, has been cut off, the root has
been cut off just like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent, a
non-living thing for the future, so the Buddha is the undisturbed. In the
disturbed state of disconnection, the Blessed One does not waver; does not shake
when he does not get it (obtain something); does not shake when he has
reputation; does not shake when he has no reputation; does not shake with
praise; does not shake with reprimand; does not shake at times; does not shake,
does not move, does not tremble. Therefore, the alone-enlightened person is the
one without greed.

"Non-deceitful," there are three types of deceit): deceit to use resources,
deceit of deportment, and deceit of talking all around for gain.

What is the trickery of using resources? Here, the homeowners invite the
bhikkhus with clothes, food, shelter, patients' necessities, and medical
necessities. He is a person with evil desire, a person with a desire for nature,
and a person with hope. He is a person who has clothes, food, shelter,
necessities of the patient, and medical necessities. Hoping for more and
rejecting clothes, refusal to give food, refusal to shelter, refusal of
patients' necessities and medical necessities, he said: "What do high-value
clothes have for a Samaṇa!" It is appropriate that a Samaṇa should use rags from
the mound room or garbage dump or in front of the shop to make coats of. What
does high-value food mean to a Samaṇa! It is appropriate that a Samaṇa should
survive by wandering for alms. What is there for a Samaṇa with high-value
accommodation! ...A Samaṇa should be those who live under the trees or between
the mounds or live in the open. ...needs of patients and medical necessities!
...should use medicine of fermented cow urine or crushed greens. After grasping
that, he wears coarse clothes; receives coarse food; lives in coarse dwellings;
uses coarse patients' necessities and medical necessities. The homeowners knew
him this way: "This Samaṇa is a person with little desire, a contented person, a
lonely person, a person who is away from the masses, a person whose vitality has
been activated, and a teacher." They invite more and more with with clothes,
food, shelter, patients' necessities, and medical necessities. He said: "The
three current states have faithful men who produce a lot of merit: the current
state of faith has faithful men, the current state that produces a lot of merit
and donation has a believing man who produces a lot of merit, and the current
state of a person worthy of support has a believing man who produces a lot of
merit. You are the believer, and the charity exists (is found), and I am the
receiver. If I don't accept it, then you will become outsiders of merit. This is
not necessary for me, but just for pity, from you, I accept." After clinging to
that, he accepts many clothes, many foods, many residences, and many patients'
necessities and medical necessities. The frowning of anyone who frowns like this
is the path of deceit, the state of deceit, this is deceit to gain resources.

What is the trickery of deportment? Here, there are certain types of evil
desirers, those who desire nature, and those who desire respect, (thought): "In
this way, people will respect me." He placed to walk, placed to stand, placed to
sit, placed to lie down, walked for desire, stood for desire, sat down for
desire, lay down for desire, walked like a person in concentration, as in
concentration he stands, sits down like a meditation person, lies down like a
meditation person, and becomes visible as a meditator. The placement,
strengthening, and complete placement of behaviors like this; the frown of this
frowning person is the path of trickery and the state of trickery, this is the
trickery of deportment.

What is the trickery of talking all around for gain? Here, there are certain
types of evil desirers, those who desire nature, and those who desire respect,
(thought): "In this way, people will respect me." He spoke according to the Holy
Dhamma, and he said: "Whoever dresses like this is a powerful Samaṇa." He said:
"Anyone who holds a bowl like this..., holding a copper bowl..., holding a water
filter..., water filter, keys, wearing shoe, a belt, ...is a Samaṇa of great
power." He said: "Whoever his followers are like this, he is a powerful Samaṇa."
He said: "Whoever his teacher is like this..., the equivalent of a bhikkhu is
like this..., the equivalent of a teacher, a friend, an acquaintance, a close
person, a companion..., he is a powerful Samaṇa." He said: "Anyone who lives in
a dwelling like this..., in a half-roof house, in a tall building, in a flat
house, in a cave, living in a cave, a hut, a heavy pavilion, an observatory,
round house, a shed, a lecture hall, a tent, living under a tree..., he is the
Samaṇa of great power."

Or, those who keep frowning; constantly frowning; those who keep tricking; those
who keep nagging; those who are respected because of their mouths, who says such
deep, secret, subtle, out-of-the-world, and empty talk: "This Samaṇa gets this
quiet residence like this and waits." The frown of anyone who frowns like this;
the path of the trick, the state of the trick, this is the trickery of the
surrounding language. For the alone-enlightened person, these three types of
tricks: tricks with money (resources), tricks with deportment, and tricks with
of speaking around for gain, have been cut off, calmed down, stopped, can't
arise and burned by the fire of wisdom, therefore, the alone-enlightened one is
a non-scheming one.

"Those who have no desire," desire is called thirst, which is greed.... The
longing, the thirsting, has been cut off for the enlightened one, and the roots
have been cut off.... Therefore, the one enlightened one is the one without
desire.

"Those who do not hide the evil, have eliminated the filth and delusions":
"Hiding evil" refers to all acts of hiding evil, hypocrisy, and jealousy.
"Filth" refers to greed, vulgarity, obscenity, sordid filth, anger...,
resentment..., hiding evil..., domineering..., all unwholesome contrived things.
"Ignorance" is ignorance in suffering, ignorance in the path leading to
suffering, ignorance in the past, ignorance in the future, in the past and the
future, the ignorance of the specific conditionality and the conditioned state,
all such ignorance, not seeing, not being aware, not enlightening, not
understanding, not firmly understanding, not to see correctly, not to examine,
bad wisdom, obsession, the torrent of ignorance, harness of ignorance, potential
trend of trouble of ignorance, entanglement of ignorance, the fence of
ignorance, the root of ignorance. For that alone-enlightened person, hiding evil
and filth and ignorance has been spit out, has been spit out completely, has
been eliminated, has been cut off.... The alone-enlightened person is the one
who does not hide the evil, and has eliminated the filth and delusion.

"Becoming one who has left the desire in all the world": Desire is called
craving, which is greed.... "In all worlds," in the world of suffering, in the
world of humans, in the world of heaven, in the world of aggregates, in the
world of the world. "Become the one who has no desire in all the worlds": In all
the worlds, become the one who has no desires; become the one who departs from
thirst; after becoming the one who departs from the desire.

> 143 &middot; Evil companions should be avoided,

One should not make friends with those who are devoted (to wrong things) and loose,  
But should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Should avoid evil companions": Anyone who has ten bases for evil views is
called an evil companion: "There is no charity, no offerings, no good or evil
kamma, no results and rewards. In this world, there is no other world, no
mother, no father, no arisen sentient beings. There is no righteous Samaṇa or
Brāhmaṇa in this world who testifies to this world and other worlds." This is an
evil companion. "Evil companions should be avoided": "Evil companions should be
avoided, should be shunned.

"The unbeneficial seer, the one who is fixed on the unrighteous": Anyone who has
the bad view, those companions of the ten bases of evil views, is called the
unprofitable seer: "No charity, no support...." "The one who is fixed on the
wrong," the one who is fixed in the wrong body kamma; the one who is fixed in
the wrong language kamma; the one who is fixed in the wrong intention kamma;

five wrong desires; fixed, deeply fixed (attached), stuck, stopped, on the five
wrong covers, to be entered, to be stained, to be turned toward, to be attached,
to be fixed, to be obstructed.

"One should not make friends with those who are keen and loose": "Keen
(enthusiasts)," those who seek and beg on all desires, those with that
character, those who have more, those who value the other, those who target
that, the hardworking person, the ones who lean towards that, the overcomer, and
the uplifter, he is a passionate person. Anyone who is seeking and begging in
all forms because of thirst..., in sound..., (omitted) in smell..., in taste...,
in touch..., ...he is also a passionate one. Whoever gets in the forms because
of thirst..., in the sound..., ....he is also a passionate person. Anyone who is
used in all forms because of thirst..., in sound..., in smell..., in taste...,
in touch.... Enthusiasts, such as critics are enthusiastic about criticism,
workers are enthusiastic about work, those who walk on the path are keen on the
path, and meditators are keen on meditation; in the same way, whoever seeks,
...is a passionate one. Anyone that is seeking and begging in the various forms
because of thirst.... Whatever is obtained in the various forms because of
thirst.... "Loose (eased, relaxed)" means that in the evil deeds of the body, or
in the evil deeds of speech, or in the evil deeds of the mind, or in the five
desires, letting go can be turned, and the heart's abandonment does not arise.
Or, the state of no respect for the practice of good Dhamma, the state of
impermanence, the state of non-stop working, the state of being stuck to the
habit, the state of neglecting desire, the state of neglecting responsibility,

one should not make friends; they should not make friends, should not engage in,
should not participate, should not be used, should not be practiced, and should

> 144 &middot; You should get close to people who learn a lot, those who hold the Dhamma,  
And excellent and eloquent friends,  
After knowing all the benefits and dispelling doubts,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Should be close to those who hear (learn) more and those who hold the Dhamma":

word is defended in the known word, and the three types of wisdom are not
hindered. To understand the wisdom, the one who has the independent

Little (that is) enjoyable, and (there is) more suffering (here),  
Like this, this is a fishing hook; after knowing this,  
The wise person should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

pleasure is inferior; this pleasure is lesser; this pleasure is lower."

"Less enjoyment and more suffering here": The Blessed One said: "Desire causes
less pleasure but more suffering and more despair, there are more troubles
here;" the Blessed One said: "desire is like a skeleton..., like a piece of
flesh..., like a torch..., a charcoal pit..., dream, a borrowed thing, the fruit

the ten types of knots are broken, driven away, after finishing, and making them
go to non-existence.

"Like a fish in the water after breaking a net": The net is called a rope net,
the water (salilaṃ) is called water (udakaṃ), and the fish (ambucārī) is called
fish (maccho). Like a fish destroys, completely destroys, and breaks, the net is
completely broken and completely broken, it walks, lives, moves, goes on,
guards, and survives. Similarly, there are two types of nets: thirst nets and
seeing nets.... For the one who is enlightened, the thirst net has been cut off,
and the seeing net has been cut off. In the state where the thirst net has been
cut off, the saw net has been cut off. In the state of mindfulness, that
individual who is enlightened is not adhered to form, sound, or smell...
(omitted); seeing, hearing, perceiving, and being aware of the dhammas, they are
not adhered to, captured, bound, not unconscious, separated, left, liberated,
already leaving the bondage, he lives with the unrestrained heart.

"As the fire does not turn back to the burned object": As the fire burns grass
fuel, it goes until it does not turn back, and the same, for the
alone-enlightened person, all the pollution that is cut off by the Sotāpanna
Path, ..., does not return.

> 149 &middot; Those whose eyes are downward and those who do not wander,  
Those who guard the roots, those who protect the mind,  
Those who have no pollutions and are not burned all over (with passion),  
Should walk alone like rhinoceros.

"The one with the eyes down and the one that does not wander": How are the eyes
confused? Here, the bhikkhu is an restless in the eyes: what should be seen
becomes invisible, and what should be crossed (over) becomes seen. From the
garden to the garden, from the village to the village, from the town to the
town, from the city to the city, from the country to the country, from the place
to the place, he sees the long parades (processions) and occasional parades in
various forms.

Or, when the bhikkhu is a visitor at home, a walker on the street, he walks
unprotected: he looks at the elephant, the horse, the cart, the infantry, the
boy, and the girl as he walks. Watching women, watching men, watching the
market, watching the door of the house, watching the top, watching the bottom,
and watching in all directions.

Or, after the bhikkhu sees a form with his eyes, he becomes a grasper of
appearance and a grasper of subtle appearance, because when he stays at the root
of his eyes, greed, sorrow and evil will flow in. He does not act according to
his self-control, does not protect the roots of the eyes, and does not achieve
self-control [SN.35.120] of the roots of the eyes.

Or if some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇa masters received food offered by faith, they
dwelt at performances and watched like this: dancing, singing, music, drama,
speaking about ancient times, handbells, cymbals, drums, magic, iron balls,
bamboo stick play, stunts, elephant fighting, horse fighting, buffalo fighting,
bull fighting, goat fighting, ram fighting, rooster fighting, quail fighting,
club fighting, fist fighting, wrestling, exercises, drills, army formations,
military parade [DN.1], etc., who are engaged in watching various performances
like this.

How is the eye down? Here, the bhikkhu is not a person with unstable eyes, and
one who does not possess (restless) eyes: what should be seen becomes
invisible..., from places to places, he didn't want to see long parades and
occasional parades in various forms.

Or, when the bhikkhu is a visitor to the home, a walker on the street, he walks
protectively: he does not look at the elephant while walking, does not look at
the horse, ...the cart..., ...the infantry..., does not look at all directions.

Or, after the bhikkhu sees the form with his eyes, he does not become a grasper
of the form or a grasper of the subtle form, because when he stays at the root
of the eye, greed, sorrow and evil will flow in, and he will act according to
his self-control, protect the root of the eye and achieve self-control of the
root of the eye.

Or if some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇa masters received the food offered by faith, they
did not dwell at at the performances and watch like this, that is: dancing,
singing, music... (omitted), avoiding watching the performances like this.

"And not wandering," how is it wandering? Here, a certain type of bhikkhu is a
wanderer, with wandering nature: from garden to garden, ..., from place to
place, he lives engaged in long parades and irregular parades.

Or a wandering bhikkhu in the bhikkhu's garden, wandering: for no benefit, no
reason, uprooted, quietly walking from the bhikkhu's room to the bhikkhu's room,
from residence to residence, from half-roof house..., from high-rise..., flat
house, cave, hut, pavilion,observation deck, tent, shed, lecture hall, round
house, tree, or where the bhikkhus sit, and he walks there, where the first
becomes the second, or the second position becomes the third position, or the
third position becomes the fourth position. There is a lot of miscellaneous
talking there, namely: the theory (talk) of kings, of thieves, ministers, army,
fear, war, food, beverage, clothing, bedding, garland, smell, kinship, cart
ride, village, town, city, land, woman, (man theory,) hero, street, water well,
ancestor spirit, various things, world origin, ocean origin, and so on [DN.1].

"One who does not wander," the one who has been separated from wandering, has
abstained, has given up, has left, has been freed, has separated from the
bondage, and is happy to be alone with an unrestrained heart. The sitting
person, the person who likes to sit alone, the practitioner of inner cessation,
the person who does not despise the jhāna, has the observer, and increases the
vacant house, the meditator, the jhāna-loving person, the singular practitioner,
and the admirer of his own interests.

"The one who protects the root, the one who protects the mind": "The one who
protects the root," The one who, seeing form with his eyes, does not become a
grasper of appearance, a grasper of details, because he when he lives at the
root of the eye he is unprotected, greed, sorrow and evil will flow in. He acts
according to his self-control, protects the eye roots, achieves self-control at
the eye roots; when he listens to sounds with his ears..., after smelling with
his nose..., after tasting the taste of the tongue..., touching the touch with
the body..., after knowing the Dhamma with consciousness, he will not become the
grasper of the aspect, the grasper of the subtle aspect, because when the mind
is not protected, he will be greedy and worried, evil and unwholesome dhammas
will flow in, and he will act according to his self-control, protect the root of
mind, and achieve self-control on the root of mind The "protective mind" is the
guardian of the mind.

"Those who have no leaks (pollution) and are not burned all over": This is said
by the Venerable Moggallāna [SN.35.243]: "Mendicants! I will teach you about
leaking and not leaking. You have to listen! Be careful! I'm going to say it."
Venerable Moggallāna said:

"Mendicants! What is a leaker? Mendicants! Here, after seeing the form with his
eyes, the bhikkhu falls in love with the desirable form, rejects the unlovable
form, lives without establishing mindfulness of the body, and their heart is
limited. Liberation: the evil and unwholesome dhammas that have arisen have no
end; after hearing the sound with ears... (omitted), after knowing the dhamma
with consciousness, fall in love with the lovable dhamma, reject the unlovable
dhamma, live in the body and have no thoughts, without the truth of mind relief,
freedom from wisdom, and wisdom liberation: those evil and unwholesome dhammas
that have arisen have no extinguishment, fellow students! This is called the
bhikkhu who is the leaker in the form that can be recognized by the eye....
Students! When the Bhikkhu lives like this, if the demon approaches him from the
eyes, the demon gets the opportunity and the demon gets the object; if the demon
approaches him from the ear... (omitted;) if the demon approaches him
intentionally he, the devil, gets the opportunity, the devil gets the object.

Mendicants! It is like a reed house or thatched house that has been dry for
three or four years. If a man approaches it with a burning torch from the east,
the fire will get the opportunity and the fire will get the object; if the man
is from the west... (omitted), if from the north..., if From the south..., if
from below..., if from above..., if a man approaches it with a burning torch no
matter which direction it is from, the fire will get the opportunity and the
fire will get the object. Similarly, fellow students! When the bhikkhu lives
like this, if the demon approaches him from the eye, the demon gets the
opportunity and the demon gets the object; if the demon is from the ear....

Mendicants! When living like this, form conquers bhikkhus rather than bhikkhus
conquering form; ...sound...; smell...; taste....; touches....; Dhamma...;
fellow students! This is called a bhikkhu who is conquered by form, conquered by
sound, conquered by smell, conquered by taste, conquered by touch, conquered by
Dhamma; conquered, not conqueror; polluted, reborn, and distressed; retribution,
he will be killed by the evil dhamma of life and death in the future. Friends!
This is the leaker.

Mendicants! How is it not to leak? Friends! Here, after seeing form with his
eyes, the bhikkhu does not fall in love with the desirable form, does not reject
the undesirable, lives having established mindfulness of the body, with an
unrestrained heart, immeasurable, truthfully knowing the mind, and liberated by
wisdom; the evil and unwholesome dhammas that arise can be destroyed. After
hearing the sound... (omitted), and liberate from wisdom: there is no end to the
evil and unwholesome Dhamma that arises, fellow students! This is called a
bhikkhu who does not leak out in terms of the forms that can be recognized by
the eye.... Friends! When the bhikkhu lives in this way, if the demon approaches
him from the eyes, the demon neither gets the opportunity nor the object; if
from the ear... (omitted) if the demon approaches him intentionally, the demon
neither gets the chance, nor the object.

Mendicants! It is like a heavy pavilion or a lecture hall newly coated with
thick clay. If a man approaches it with a burning torch from the east, the fire
will neither have a chance nor an object; if it is from the west..., no matter
which direction it is from, the fire will neither get the chance nor the object.
Similarly, fellow students! When the bhikkhu lives like this, if the demon
approaches him from the eye, the demon will neither get the opportunity nor the
object..., if the demon approaches him deliberately, the demon will neither get
the opportunity nor the object.

Mendicants! When living in this way, bhikkhus conquer form are not conquered by
form;and non-form; ...sound...; ...tastes..., smells, touches, Dhamma, ...fellow
students! This is called the bhikkhu conquering form, conquering sound,
conquering smell, conquering taste, conquering touch, conquering the Dhamma; the
conqueror, not the conquered; he conquers the polluted, regenerated, distressed,
and bitter, the evil and unwholesome Dhamma of life and death in the future.
Friends! This is the one who does not leak."

"Those who are not burned all over," those who are not burnt by the scorching
heat of greed; those who are not burned by the scorching heat of anger; those
who are not burned by the scorching heat of ignorance.

> 150 &middot; After leaving the marks of the family member (layperson),  
Like a pāricchattaka tree covered with leaves,  
In the yellow robes, after leaving home,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"After taking off the mark of the layman": hair, beard..., are called the mark
of the layman. "After taking off the mark of the family member": After the
family member's mark is abandoned, after completely abandoning, after putting
down, after stopping.

"Like a pāricchattaka tree covered with leaves": Like the pāricchattaka tree
with dense leaves and thick shade. Similarly, that alone-enlightened person is a
perfect mantle-bearer. (Some translations of this sutta use "...having shed its
leaves;" this seems in line with previous verses and makes sense in context, but
does not seem to be what is literally written here).

"In the robes, after leaving home": The single-conscious person cut off all
obstacles of the house, cut off the obstacles of his children and wife, ...of
relatives, ...friends, ...storage; after removing the obstacles, shaved hair and
beard, wrapped in robes, went from home to a non-domestic (monastic) life, and
began to walk alone, live, act, go on, guard, and survive, after becoming in a
state of nothing.

### Fourth Chapter

> 151 &middot; In terms of taste, not being a greedy person,  
A person who is not desiring, a person who does not nurture others,  
A second-time beggar (not skipping houses), not restrained to any family,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"In terms of taste, one who is not greedy or desiring": "Taste," there are root,
branch, skin, leaf, flower, fruit, sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, alkaline,
astringent, pleasant, unpleasant, cold, and hot. Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas are
greedy for taste. They wander around for the best taste with their tongues.
After they get the sour taste, they ask for no sour taste, and ask for sourness
after getting no sourness; ...(omitted) sweetness ...(omitted); bitterness,
spicy, salty, alkali; when they get the sour taste, they look for the
astringency, when they get the astringency, look for the sour taste; ...pleasant
taste..., unpleasant...; ...unpleasant..., pleasant...; ...hot..., cold...;
...cold..., hot. They are greedy, craving, tied, fascinated, tainted, attached,
fixed, in the desire for taste, being obstructed. For the alone-enlightened
person, the taste and thirst and love have been cut off, ..., he eats food after
inspecting it logically: "Neither for pleasure, nor for intoxication, not for a
good figure, not for dignity, but for the survival of this body, to stop harm,
and to support the Brahma. In this way, I will repel the previous feelings, not
arouse new feelings, be healthy, without fault, and live in peace."

For example, if he applies oil to the sore, it is only for the purpose of
growing (flesh), or, if he applies oil to the axle, only for the purpose of
transporting goods, or, if he eats his son's meat it is only for the purpose of
passing through the desert. In the same way, the alone-enlightened person eats
food after introspection: "Neither for pleasure...." He is separated from the
craving of taste, quit, departed, left, been freed, and being unbound, he lives
with an unrestrained heart.

"Those who are not greedy," greed is called craving, which is greed, lust,
acquiescence, conformity, joy, desire, obsession, taking, contaminated,
disturbance, fraud, (reincarnation) root cause, (bitter) fertility, tailoring
(greed), net, river, bondage, rope, attachment, accumulation, companionship,
desire, intimate interaction, forest, jungle, love, expectation, relationship,
desire for form, desire for sounds, desire for smells, desire for tastes, desire
for touches, desire for acquisition, desire for wealth, desire for sons, desire
for life, the state of desire, hope, prayer, greedy appearance, possessing
greed, inquiring for profit, illegal greed, improper greed, hope, envy, desire
for desire, desire for nothingness, desire for form, formless thirst,
extinguished thirst, form thirst, sound thirst, smell thirst, taste thirst,
touch thirst, dhamma thirst, torrent, harness, binding, clinging, obstacles,
covering, defilements, potential trends of troubles, entanglement, vines,
stinginess, suffering roots, causes of suffering, occurrence of suffering,
magical nets, magical hooks, magical food, the realm of the devil, the residence
of the devil, the state of the devil, the bondage of the devil, the river of
thirst, the net of thirst, the rope of thirst, the sea of thirst, craving,
greed, and the root of unwholesomeness. That greed and thirst have been cut off
for the enlightened one, ..., therefore, the alone-enlightened ones are the ones
who are not greedy.

"Those who don't nurture other people, second-order beggars": "Those who don't
raise other people," For that alone-enlightened person, only nurture themselves,
not others.

"Those who do not nurture others, those who already know,  
Those who have been tamed, those who have settled in the core,  
Those who have exhausted their troubles and those who have eliminated their faults,  
I say he is a Brāhmaṇa."  
[Ud.6]

"Those who do not nurture others, second-time beggars": The alone-enlightened
person puts on his clothes in the early afternoon, takes the mantle, has guarded
his body, has guarded his words, has guarded his heart, and his mind has
emerged, with the protection of the roots, in order to enter a village or town
as a beggar, those who have their eyes down and behave adequately, go from home
to home without crossing to beg for alms.

"Do not be bound in the center of a family": the mind is bound in two ways:
making oneself humble, and others stand noble while the heart is bound, or
making others stand humble, and oneself stand noble and the heart is bound. How
to make yourself humble and make others stand up noble and flatter others?
(Thinking:) "You are very helpful to me, I rely on you to get clothes, food,
shelter, the needs of patients, medical necessities, and anyone who gives or
wants to do they think I am dependent on you, those who are regarded as you, all
my previous names from my parents have disappeared to me, because you are known
as those who frequent (someone's) home like that; those who often visit
(someone's) home." This is to make oneself humble, to make others stand noble,
and their hearts are bound.

How to make others humble and make oneself stand noble and be restrained?
(Thinking:) "I am a good person to you. Because of me, you turn to the Buddha,
to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha, become (as) those who are free from killing,
those who have not given and take, those who have not given, and those who are
free from lying, and those who (do not) drink spirits, fruit wine, and wine, I
will give you instructions, give me a lot of questions, I will explain uposatha,
and build temples. However, after you abandon me, you respect, honor, and revere
other people." This is to make others humble, and make oneself stand noble, and
the heart is bound. For those who pity for friends and confidants, their
interests are lost and the heart is bound.

"Do not be fettered in the center of one family": The mind of the
alone-enlightened person is not fettered by the obstacles of the family; the
heart is not fettered by the obstacles of the group (people); ...the residence;
...the clothes; ...group feeding; ...shelter; ...patient's needs and medical
necessities.

> 152 &middot; After giving up the five covers of the mind,  
After expelling all the defilements,  
After cutting off love and aversion, independent,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Giving up the five covers of the mind": The one who is alone-enlightened, the
desire being obliterated, after giving up, after abandoning, after being driven
away, after finishing, after making it go to non-existence, the malicious
cover..., sleeping cover..., regret cover..., doubt cover..., after giving up,
after abandoning, after being driven away, after finishing, after making it go
to non-existence, after leaving desire, leaving unwholesome dhammas, after
entering into the joy and happiness of the first jhāna, after separation.

"After having expelled all defilements": Greed is the heart that follows the
defilements; anger is the heart that follows the defilements; ignorance is the
heart that follows the defilements; anger..., resentment.... "After expelling
all the defilements": After expelling all the defilements, after removing, after
abandoning, after being expelled, after finishing, and making them go to
non-existence.

"The non-dependent one cuts off love and aversion": "The non-dependent" has two
types of dependence: the dependence of craving and the dependence of seeing....
"Love," there are two types of love: the love of thirsting and the love of
seeing.... "Aversion," that is the state of anger, hostility, disgust, aversion,
evil, anger of the heart, aggrieved, angry state, abusive, irritated, irritated
state, hostility, brutal anger, rage, displeased heart. "The unrestrained one
cuts off the love and the aversion": The thirsty love and the seeing love and
the aversion, to the alone-enlightened one, is cut off, severed, after
abandoning, after driving away, after finishing, making it come to
non-existence; there are those who do not adhere to the eyes, those who do not
adhere to the ears..., the unstuck, the unclinging, the person who does not turn
his heart toward (these things). He who has left, has departed, has been
liberated, has been separated from bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.

> 153 &middot; After putting aside happiness and suffering,  
And the joy and worry before (previously),  
After getting purity, peace, and calm,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"After putting aside happiness and suffering, and the joy and sorrow before":
The alone-enlightened one who renounced pleasure and sorrow, and with the
extinction of the joy and sorrow previously, enters and lives without suffering,
not suffering, or happiness in the calm of the fourth jhāna.

"After gaining purity, peace, and calm": "Calm," that is the peace, lack of
caring, onlooking, the cessation of the mind, the equality of the mind, the
peaceful state of the mind, the neutral state of the mind in the fourth jhāna.
"Calm" means the mind's cessation, stability, undistracted, stable mind, smooth
mind, calm (stopping), fixed root, steady force, and concentration. The peace
and calm in the fourth jhāna are pure, completely pure, all pure, purified,
non-filthy, free from defilements, malleable, suitable for work, standing still,
and immutable. "After getting purity, peace, calm": The peace in the fourth
jhāna, After calm is obtained, after obtaining, after possessing, after
receiving.

> 154 &middot; Those whose vitality has been activated in order to obtain the highest interests,  
Those who do not shrink from their hearts, those who do not slack in their behaviors,  
Those who are firm, hardworking, with fortitude and strength,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Those whose vitality has been activated for the gain of the highest interest":
The highest interest is called non-living, Nibbāna, which is the cessation of
all actions, the cessation of all attachments, the extinction of craving, greed,
annihilation, Nibbāna. In order to obtain, receive, reach, contact, and testify
for the highest interests, live in the abandonment of unwholesome dhammas, for
the fullness of good Dhamma, vitality has been activated, fortitude, firm
efforts, and non-negligence of the responsibility of good Dhamma.

"Those who do not shrink in their minds and do not slacken their actions": The
one who is alone-enlightened arouses vitality, devotes himself, and works hard
for the evil and unwholesome dhammas that have not arisen; for the evil and
unwholesome dhammas that have arisen, to give up... (omitted), for the arising
of the unborn good Dhamma..., for the survival, not disappearing, increase,
expansion, and completion of the practice of the good Dhamma that has arisen,
desire, hard work, vitality, dedication, diligence.

Or,  
"I am willing to leave only skin, tendons, and bones;  
If the flesh and blood of the body is dried up,  
As long as people's perseverance, human strength,  
Human vitality, and human efforts should (persist)  
But (the goal is) not achieved,  
There will be no cessation of vitality."  
[SN.12.2]

"I will neither eat nor drink,  
Nor go out of my residence,  
Will not cause the thigh to fall (lying down),  
While the arrow of thirst is not be removed."  
[Thag.223]

"As long as my heart is not freed from the troubles by not clinging,  
I will not break this cross-legged (posture)!"  
[MN.32]

"As long as my mind is not free from the troubles with non-clinging, I will not
get up from this seat."

"I will not go down from the scripture... (omitted), I will not go out from the
residence..., I will not go out from the half-roofed house..., the tall
building, the flat house, cave, hut, heavy pavilion, observation deck, round
house, shed, lecture hall, tent..., as long as my heart is not free from all
defilements without clinging, I will not go out from the tree."

"Just before this noon, I will obtain, fully obtain, attain, reach, and testify
to the Holy Dhamma." He is dedicated and diligent, so he is also a person who
does not shrink from his heart and who does not slacken his behavior. "Just at
noon... (omitted), in the evening..., before eating, after eating, before the
night, the night, after the night, at the time of death, at the time of the
white moon, during the rainy season, in the winter, summer, youth, adolescence,
middle-age, old age..., I will acquire, fully acquire, attain, reach, and
testify about the Holy Dhamma." He is dedicated and diligent, and so is also a
person who does not shrink in heart and does not slack in behavior.

"Strong hard work, fortitude, and strength": The alone-enlightened one is a
strong holder of good Dhamma, in good deeds in body, in words, good intentions,
generosity and sharing, precepts and prohibitions, deeds of filial piety to his
mother, deeds of filial piety to his father, respect to Samaṇas, respect to
Brāhmaṇas, respect to the oldest person in the family, certain holders who live
up to the highest virtues [DN.30]. "With fortitude, and a strength-sufficient
person," the alone-enlightened person has, fully has, reached, fully reached,
possessed, fully possessed fortitude, strength, vitality, hard work, wisdom.

> 155 &middot; Those who sit alone, do not ignore jhāna,  
And always follow the Dhamma,  
Having explored the misery in existence,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Sit alone, do not ignore jhāna": The alone-enlightened person is a person who
is willing to sit alone, a person who loves to sit alone, and a practitioner of
inner cessation, does not despise jhāna, has the observer, and increases the
vacant house, the meditator, the jhāna-loving person, the singular practitioner,
and the admirer of their own interests, are those who sit alone. "Do not ignore
jhāna," the one who is enlightened in two ways doesn't neglect jhāna: for the
emergence of the first jhāna that has not arisen, to become harnessed, strongly
harnessed, fully harnessed; or the second jhāna..., or the third jhāna..., or
the fourth jhāna....

Or, the first jhāna has arisen, practice and more practice, or the second jhāna
has arisen..., or the third jhāna..., or the fourth jhāna has been born..., so
that he does not ignore jhāna.

"A person who always follows the Dhamma": Four mindfulnesses... (omitted)...,

survives.

"I have explored the misery in all existence": "All actions are impermanent,"
..., "all actions are suffering"..., "all dhammas are selfless"..., "any
collection of dhammas is an extinction of dhammas." I have probed misery in all
being.

> 156 &middot; Those who wish for the extermination of love, those who do not let go,  
Those who are wise, those who learn more, those who have mindfulness,  
The perceiver, decider, and diligent one of the Dhamma  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Hope for the extinction of the thirst for love, the one who does not let go":
The thirst of "thirst for love"..., the end of the death, the end of ignorance,
the end of interest, the end of rebirth, the end of rotation, the end of being,
the end of reincarnation, the end of the cycle, eager, and supplicating. "The
one who does not let go," the one who is alone is a respectful actor, a regular
actor... (omitted) in good Dhamma, not neglecting responsibility, the one who
doesn't let go.

"The wise, the hearer (of learning), the thoughtful": "The wise one (not the
deaf and mute)," the one who is enlightened alone is the wise, the enlightened,
the distinguished, and the wise. "The one who hears more," the one who is alone
aware is the one who hears more, remembers what has been heard, accumulates what
has been heard, all that which has goodness in the beginning, goodness in the
middle, and goodness in the end; correct meaning and correct words, proclaiming
that there is only a complete and pure Brāhmaṇa Dhamma. Such Dhamma has been
heard, remembered, recited, observed with the heart, and penetrated by seeing
the good. "Those who have mindfulness" are the one who is alone-enlightened, and
have the highest level of thought and intelligence. They are the memorizers and
recallers who did it a long time ago and said it a long time ago.

"The Dhamma-seeker, the decider, and the diligent": The Dhamma-understander is
called wisdom, which is wisdom, understanding, simple selection, investigation,
discernment, recognition, discrimination, close observation, inspection, learned
virtuous wisdom, proficiency, cleverness, study, reflection, review,
contemplation, examination, general comprehensive wisdom, vipassanā, right
knowledge, stabbing rod, wisdom root, wisdom sword, wisdom palace, wisdom
brightness, wisdom light, no delusion, choice of dhamma, right view. The one who
is alone-enlightened is the perceiver of the Dhamma, the knower of the Dhamma,
the measurer of the Dhamma, the judge of the Dhamma, the clearer of the Dhamma:
"all actions are impermanent," ...the clearer of the Dhamma. Or, for the
alone-enlightened one, he is the enlightened person of the realm, the
enlightened person of the place, the enlightened person of the interest, the
enlightened person of the rebirth, the enlightened person of the revolving, the
enlightened person of being, the enlightened person of rotation, the enlightened
person of reincarnation. Or, the one who is enlightened is the one who lives in
the ultimate (boundary), the one who lives in the world, the one who lives in
the ultimate, the one who lives in the ultimate place of interest, the one who
lives in the final life, the one who stands at the end of the incarnation, the
