> 30 &middot; [Venerable Dhotaka like this:]  
Blessed One, I ask you, please tell me this,  
Great rishi! I look forward to your words,  
After hearing what you said,  
One should learn for one's own Nibbāna.

"Master, let me ask you, please tell me this": "I ask," I ask of you; I beg you;
please make me clear; please tell me. "The Blessed One" is synonymous with
respect. In addition, the "greed breaker" is the Blessed One; the "sickness
destroyer" is the Blessed One; "the one who has destroyed conceit" is the
Blessed One; "the one who has destroyed the thorns" is the Blessed One; "the one
who has destroyed the pollutants" is Blessed One; "the one who has ended" is the
Blessed One; "the one who has practiced the body, the precepts, the mind, and
the wisdom" is the Blessed One; or "the Blessed One is close to the woods, wild
forests, and border dwellings (sitting place), where speaking is lessened, it is
quiet, away from the human atmosphere, alone, and suitable for sitting alone" is
the Blessed One; or "the Blessed One is the one who divides clothes, food,
shelter, the needs of patients, and medical necessities"; or "the Blessed One is
the one who has the taste of righteousness, the taste of Dhamma, the taste of
liberation, the increased precepts, the mind, and the wisdom"; or "the Blessed
One is the four types of jhāna, the four immeasurables, the four formlessness,
etc., the one who divides is the Blessed One"; or the Blessed One is the one who
has the eighth liberation, the eight victories, the ninth dwelling place, etc.;
or the Blessed One is the practice of ten thoughts, (ten) abidings, the one who
(observes) the in and out of breath; the one who is purely divided is the
Blessed One; or the Blessed One divides the four mindfulness, the four
righteousness, the four divine bases (iddhipāda), the five faculties, the five
powers, the seven enlightenment factors, and the eight branches of the holy
path; or the Blessed One is ten Tathāgata, four fearlessness, four unobstructed
solutions, six supernatural powers and the six enlightenment methods. "Blessed
One," this name is not given by the mother; not given by the father; not given
by brothers; not given by sisters; not given by friends; not given by relatives;
not given by Samaṇas or Brāhmaṇas; not given by heaven; it is ultimate
liberation; the establishment (of the pseudonym) for the acquisition and
testimony of the Buddha, the Blessed One, under the Bodhi tree, and all
knowledge and wisdom, that is, the Blessed One.

"[Venerable Dhotaka like this]": "Like this," "Like this," the continuation of
the sentences, the connection of the words, the completion of the sentences, the
combination of words, this is the order of the sentence, which is "like this."
"Venerable," this is a synonym of love, respect, and obedience. "Dhotaka," the
name, title, security of the Brāhmaṇa, title, word, phrase.

"Great rishi! I look forward to your words": Your words, ways of speaking,
teaching, teaching, admonition, I expect, I hope, I pray. "Great rishi," why is
the Blessed One the Great rishi? The "seekers, and pursuers of the great
precepts" are the great rishis. ...of the great concentration..., ...of the
great liberation aggregate..., "the seeker and pursuer of the great liberation
of wisdom and insight" is the great rishi; the fragments gathered by the
dark..., the destruction of the great upside down..., the pulling out of the big
arrow of thirst..., the unraveling of the accumulation of sight..., the lifting
of the big conceit flag, ...the calming of the great work..., the calming of the
big torrent..., the laying down of the heavy burden..., the severance of the
cycle of the great reincarnation..., the disappearance of the great heat..., the
cessation of the great heat..., "the seeker and the pursuer who lifts the flag
of Dhamma in his heart" is the great rishi; the great minds..., the great
exertion..., the great divine bases..., the great roots..., the power..., the
great enlightenment branches..., the big eight branches of the holy path...,
"the immortality of the great supreme benefit, the seeker of Nibbāna, the
pursuer" is great rishi; "sought, pursued, and searched for by powerful beings:
Where is the Buddha? Where is the Blessed One? Where is the god among the gods?
Where is the bull king among people?" Such is the great rishi. "The highest
Dhamma," the highest Dhamma is called non-living, Nibbāna, that is the cessation
of all actions, the cessation of all attachments, the cessation of craving,
greed, extinguishment, and Nibbāna.

"After hearing your words": Your speech, language, teachings admonitions; after
hearing, after grasping, after understanding, after discriminating.

"You should learn for your own Nibbāna": There are three types of learning: to
learn to increase precepts, to learn to increase mind, and to also learn to
increase wisdom.

What is meant by "to increase precepts?" Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who
lives in the protection of self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient
righteousness and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns
after accepting from a teacher. Small precepts aggregate and large precept
aggregates are the foundation of abstinence, the (self) inhibition of behavior,
the entrance of self-control, the uppermost of good dhamma, etc., this is to
increase precept learning.

What is meant by "to increase mind?" Here, the bhikkhu starts from the desire to
escape... (omitted) the first jhāna..., the second jhāna..., the third jhāna...,
after entering, he lives in the fourth jhāna (neither suffering or joyous, from
calm and chanting), this is "to learn to increase mind."

What is learning to increase wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a wise person,
possessing the knowledge of arising and passing away; the holy, insight, and the
complete extinction of suffering is (the wisdom), he truthfully knows "This is
suffering. ...(omitted)" "this is hard work."... "this is the path that leads to
suffering"... "these are troubles"... "this is the set of troubles"... "this is
annoyance"... "this is the path leading to troubles;" this is the addition of
wisdom. These three learnings, they learn when they face (note); they learn when
they know; they learn when they see (; when they learn with introspection); they
learn when the mind is established (in a decision); they learn when faith
prevails; they learn with vigor and hard work; when mindfulness arises, they
learn; when mind is set (focused) they learn; when wisdom is learned, they
learn; when they are proved to have known, they learn; they learn through
renunciation; they learn when they practice; they practice well, and sustain
when they are testified, then they go on. For this reason they are called
learning. "Everyone" is the multitude. These learned practitioners are the
Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmī, Anāgāmī, and Arahant.

"For your own Nibbāna," to extinguish your own greed, ...anger, ..ignorance,
...(omitted); to calm, silence, extinguish, cut off, and cease all unwholesome
practices, you should learn to increase precepts, you learn to increase mind,
and you should learn to increase wisdom. These three learnings should be studied
when directed towards (noting); when known they should be learned; when seen...
(omitted); when introspecting...; and being careful to establish (a decision),
you should learn; you should learn when you win by faith; you should learn when
you have energetic effort; you should learn when mindfulness arises; you should
learn with mindfulness; you should learn when you know with wisdom; we should
learn when we can testify; we should learn when we can know; we should learn
when we should be renounced; we should learn when we should be practiced as
testimony; [Ps.1,41] learning should be practiced, should be carried out well,
one should go on after accepting.

> 31 &middot; [Blessed One: "Dhotaka!"]  
If that is the case, please be enthusiastic,  
And wise and mindful here,  
After hearing these words,  
You should learn for your own Nibbāna.

"If that's the case, please be enthusiastic": Please be enthusiastic, please be
brave, please be zealous, please have fortitude, please be firm, please be
vigorous; and may you make it happen, make it arise, make it fully produced,
make it appear, make it live.

"Dhotaka," .... "Blessed One," ....

"Wise and mindful here": "Here," belonging to this view, to this liking, to this
inclination, in this attachment, in this Dhamma; in this teaching; in this
Brahma, in the teachings of this master, in this individual, in this human
world. "Wise," the concious, the enlightened, the discriminating, the wise.

"Mindful," Mindful in four ways: when practicing mindfulness on the body, when
practicing mindfulness on perception, when watching the mind in the heart, when
the practice is in line with the teachings, it is mindful.

And again in four ways: the state of avoiding non-mind, the state of the Dhamma
that should be done to the mind, the state of the Dhamma that is obstructed by
the mind, the state of the mindfulness factor (phase) not being forgotten.

And again in four ways: the state of possessing mindfulness, the state of
abiding in mindfulness, the state of experiencing mindfulness, and the state of
mindfulness not lowering.

And again in four ways: with the state of being mindful as the object of
mindfulness, the quiet state as the object, the calm state as the object, the
state of silence; the recollection of the Buddha, the recollection of the
Dhamma, the recollection of the Saṅgha, the precepts, the alms, of the mind;
mindfulness of the in and out breath, of death, of the body, of silence; all
mindfulness, free-mindfulness..., the path without a fork, are called
mindfulness. Having been fully possessed, reaching fully, possessing, arriving,
with this thought, he is called mindful.

"After hearing these words": ....

"You should learn for your own Nibbāna": ....

> 32 &middot; (Dhotaka:) I see a Brāhmaṇa owning nothing  
In the world of heaven and the world of man,  
I salute you, all-seeing one, Sakyamuni!  
Please free me from doubts.

"I see, in heaven and the world of man": "Heaven," there are three types of
heaven: general (secular, worldly) heaven, rebirth heaven, and pure heaven. What
is secular heaven? Kings and princes and queens are called secular heavens. What
is the rebirth heaven? The four great god kings, the realm of the thirty-three
gods, Tusita heaven, fashioned heaven, all Brahma heavens, and all the heavens
above that are called rebirth heavens. What is pure heaven? The troubles of the
disciples of the Tathāgata, Arahants, and Paccekabuddhas, have been exhausted,
this is called pure heavens. The Blessed One is of the general heaven, the
rebirth heaven, the pure heaven, and the victorious heaven, the heaven among the
heaven, the lion among the lions, the dragon among the dragons, the lord among
the lords, the Muni among the Munis, the king among the kings. "I see in the
heavens and in the world of man": In the world of man and the heavens, I see, I
see the superior heaven, I see the heaven in the heaven; I see, I watch, I
contemplate, I observe.

"Brāhmaṇa actors (doers) without possessions": "No," no greed, no hatred,
ignorance, sloth, seeing (views), pollution, evil deeds; any of these, for the
Blessed One, it has been cut off, and the roots have been cut off, just like a
palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and non-living for the future.
Therefore, the Buddha is called the non-owner. "Brāhmaṇa," the Blessed One is
the one in the state of excluding the seven dhammas: seeing is excluded,
suspicion is excluded, abstinence.., greed..., aversion, ignorance, sloth, and
those evil and unwholesome dhammas are excluded: those that are polluted, there
are again. People who are fearful, who suffer the consequences, and will die in
the future.

The Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 524]  
"After all evil is eliminated,  
Standing the spotless, virtuous state,  
After he transcends reincarnation,  
He becomes a perfect person.  
Those who are not dependent,  
Like this can be called Brāhmaṇa."

"Actor," walker, doer, dweller, on-goer, guardian, and survivor.

"I respect you, all-seeing one": "You," he addressed the Blessed One. "I
respect," I respect with my body, or I respect with words, or I respect with my
heart, or I respect in intention, or I follow the Dhamma to show respect,
salute. "All-seeing," all-eyes are called the state of all knowing wisdom. The
Blessed One has the state of intelligence, of fully having, entering, fully
entering, sufficiently having, having all the knowledge.

"For him, there is nothing unseen here (in this world),  
There is no knowledge that cannot be known,  
He proves that everything that exists should be guided by inference,  
Because the Tathāgata, like that, is all-eyes."  
[Ps.1]

"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubts": "Sakyamuni," Sakyamuni is a bhikkhu
from the house of Sakya. This is Sakyamuni. Or, "the rich, the wealthy," this is
also Sakyamuni. For him there are these wealth, namely: trusting wealth,
abstaining from wealth, ashamed of wealth, hearing about wealth, giving wealth,
wisdom wealth, mindfulness of wealth, righteous wealth, divine wealth, root
wealth, strength wealth, enlightenment wealth, Path wealth, Fruit wealth,
Nibbāna wealth, and use these various treasures as the rich, the wealthy. Or,
those who are possible, those who are able, those who flow out all types of
things, those who are sufficient, those who are heroes, those who are brave,
those who are heroic, those who are not timid, those who are not frightened,
those who do not run away, those who have given up fear of fear, those who have
given up terror and fear. "Doubts" are called doubts: doubt of suffering, doubt
of the path leading to suffering, doubt of the future, doubt of the past, doubt
of the future and the past, doubt of causal connections, such doubts,
suspicions, doubtful states, confusion, hesitation, crossroads, inconsistent
grasping, hesitating, incomplete understanding, stiff state, confusion of mind.
"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubt": Please free me, please release me, pull
me out, please pull me out completely, bring me out of doubt.

> 33 &middot; (The Blessed One:) I will not be able to liberate, Dhotaka,  
Anyone who doubts in the world,  
When you know the best Dhamma,  
Then you will get through this torrent.

"I will not be able to liberate": I will not be able to release, free, make
liberated, pull out, pull out completely, make to ascend, make to fully ascend,
a being struck by the arrow of doubt. Or, I don't work hard on the unbelievers,
on the unwilling, on the slack, on those with inferior vitality, on the
inactive; I don't do my best, I don't strive, I don't do with valor, I don't
work with enthusiasm, I don't make fortitude, I don't make determination, I
don't make vitality, I don't make it produce, I don't make it appear, I don't
make it fully produced, I don't make it arise, I don't make it give birth to the
teachings of the Dhamma. Or, you don't have any other liberators. Those who can
be liberated use their own fortitude, with their own energy, with their own
striving, with their own brave efforts, with their own power, with their own
human power, with their own human vitality, with their own work, with their own
correct way of doing, following the path, not going the opposite way, the way of
following the Dhamma, and the way of doing the Dhamma, they can be freed.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Cunda! 'I am the one who has fallen into the
quagmire and will pull out the other people who have fallen into the quagmire.'
This is impossible. Cunda! 'I am an unregulated, untrained, non-Nibbāna one. I
will make others tune, train, and attain Nibbāna.' This is impossible." [MN.8]

This is said by the Blessed One: [Dph.12,165]  
"He who has done evil, he is polluted,  
He who does do not do evil, He come pure,  
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure."

This was also said by the Blessed One: "Similarly, Brāhmaṇa, Nibbāna stays and
abides, the path which leads to Nibbāna stays and abides, and my persuasion
(teaching) stays and abides. However, when my disciples are taught and
admonished in this way, some of them reach the ultimate end of Nibbāna, and some
do not reach. Brāhmaṇa, What can I do here? Brāhmaṇa, The Tathāgata is the
guide. [MN.107] The Buddha only told (directed) the way, and when they practice
it by themselves, they could be free."

"Any doubter in the world": A doubter, a person who has doubts, confusion, and
hesitation. "Any (person)," any khattiya, or Brāhmaṇa, or vessa, or sudda, or
layman, or bhikkhu, or heaven, or person. "In the world," in the world of the
suffering world... (omitted).

"When knowing the most triumphant Dhamma": The highest Dhamma is called
non-living, Nibbāna, which is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of
all attachments, the cessation of craving, greed, extinguishment, and Nibbāna.
Supreme, the first, the most victorious, the extraordinary, the highest, the
most advanced Dhamma; when knowing, distinguishing, understanding, through.

"This way you will get through this torrent": Such a torrent of desire, the
torrent of seeing, the torrent of ignorance, you can get through, you can
surpass, you can you can overcome the torrent.

> 34 &middot; (Dhotaka:) Brāhmaṇa! I ask, out of compassion,  
Teach me the Dhamma of seclusion,  
(So that) as the void is not bound,  
Here I can walk silently and unrestrained.

"Brāhmaṇa! Please teach the commandment out of compassion": Brāhmaṇa, please
teach the commandment; Brāhmaṇa, please help; Brāhmaṇa, please be merciful. "The
compassionate person," The compassionate, the sympathizer, the protector, the
funder, the compassionate.

"The Dhamma of seclusion, that I can know": Seclusion Dhamma is called
non-living, Nibbāna, that is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of all
attachments, the extinction of craving, greed, extinction, and Nibbāna. "I can
know," I can know, discern, know for sure, understand, prove, reach, and
testify.

"As the void (space) is not bound": As the void is not stuck, not captured, not
bound, not tied to the world, then it is the one who is not stuck, not captured,
and not tied, the one who is not all-bound. (Or,) as the emptiness is not dyed
with carmine, or golden yellow, or indigo, or deep red, then the one who is not
dyed (stained), the one who is not angry, the one who does not change foolishly,
and the one who does not pollute. As the void does not get angry, is not
abusive, does not resist, and is not attacked, this is the one who is not angry,
the one who is not abusive, the one who does not resist, the one who is not
attacked, and the one who does not fight back.

"Here I can walk silently and unrestrainedly": "Here, silently," when you are
here; when you are sitting here; when you are sitting on this seat; when sitting
down among the crowd. Or, just here is silent, calm, cooled, stopped. There are
two types of dependence: the dependence of craving and the dependence of
seeing... (omitted). After the dependence of love has been cut off, and the
dependence of seeing has been cut off, one becomes non-dependent on the eyes,
...the ear..., the nose, tongue, body, mind, forms, sounds, smells, tastes,
touches, dhammas, family, group, residence, gain, reputation, praise, clothes,
food, dwelling, (patient's needs and medical necessities), the desire realm, the
formed realm, the formless realm, the desire to be, the desire for the formless,
the desire to have, to exist, one aggregate, four aggregates, five aggregates,
past, future, present, what you see, hear, feel, and can perceive; those who do
not adhere to, those who do not fall into, those who do not turn their minds
towards, those who have left, have given up, have been freed, have been
separated from the bondage, living with an unrestrained heart. "Can do" can
live, can act, can go on, can guard, can survive.

> 35 &middot; [The Blessed One: "Dhotaka!"]

Known in (real) life rather than (through) rumor,

Can cross over love (desire) in the world.

dhammas" means in the Dhamma that is seen (in the current life), in the Dhamma
that is known, in the Dhamma that is measured, in the Dhamma that is made clear;
this is what I will talk about, in the real life. Or, I will tell you about the
suffering which is seen, I will tell you about the collection which is seen, I
will tell you the way which is seen, I will tell you about the extinction of
what is seen, and this is what I will talk about, in the present. Or, in the
life as directly visible, instant, inviting you to see, able to guide, and the
wise should experience it by themselves; this is what I will talk about, in this
life. "Not rumors," not anecdotal, not from hearsay, not from inheritance, not
from scripture, not from logical inference, not from reasoning, not because of
theoretical reflection, not because of an opinion received after reflection, but
by oneself. The known and self-evidenced Dhamma, I will talk about that.

Anyone who knows which, living mindfully,  
Can cross through love in the world.

"Upper, lower, and middle four directions": "Up" is the future, "down" is the
past, "middle four" is the present; "up" is the heavenly world, "down" is the
hell world, "middle four" is the world of human beings. Or, "up" is good Dhamma,
"down" is unwholesome Dhamma, "middle four" is non-marked Dhamma; "up" is the
formless realm, "down" is the desire realm, and "middle four" is the physical
realm; "up" means joy, "down" means suffering, "middle four" means neither
suffering nor joy; "up" means above the sole of the foot, "down" means below the
hair, and "middle four" means in the middle.
