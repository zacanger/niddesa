### Second Chapter

> 131 &middot; If you get a wise companion,  
One who walks with you, who lives with kindness, one who is wise,  
After defeating all the dangers,  
One should walk with him mindfully and happily.  
[Dph.23,328]

"If you get a wise companion": If you get, receive, gain, have a wise,
conscious, separate, and wise companion.

"Walker, good dweller, wise one": "walker," one who walks alone. "Good dweller,"
one who lives in the first jhāna is in the good dweller, and also the second...,
third..., fourth jhāna is the good dweller, the benevolent and liberating is the

inhabitants of extinction, and those who are the most good inhabitants of the
Fruit. "The wise ones," the wise are the wise, the enlightened, the separated,

The only enlightened person should be with the wise, enlightened, distinguished,
and wise companion; to be happy, satisfied, rejoicing, enthusiastic, happy to
walk, live, act,go on, guard, and survive together. "Thinking one," that alone

intelligence, and is the memorizer and recaller who did it a long time ago and
said it a long time ago [SN.48.9].

> 132 &middot; If you don't get a wise companion,  
One who walks with you, one who lives with kindness, one who is wise,

storehouse, many gold stores, and the city. After shaving his hair and beard and
putting on robes, he went from being at home to living a non-domestic (monastic)
life. After entering a state of no possessions, he walked, lived, moved, went
on, guarded, and survived. In this way, the one who lives alone after cutting
off all obstacles in the home, cutting off the obstacles of children and wives,
cutting off the obstacles of relatives, cutting off the obstacles of friends [,
cutting off the obstacles of storage], shave off the hair and beard and put on
the robes; after leaving home and becoming one who lives a non-domestic

> 133 &middot; Indeed we praise our (good) companions,

no-fault eaters can't get them, after they don't get them, after they don't
obtain them, after they don't have them, they don't receive them, they don't

they have friction in the human world, and they have friction in the heavenly
world. Interest and interest... death and death... rebirth and rebirth... have
and have... reincarnation and reincarnation... circulation and circulation. They

What is a human companion? There is a class of people who cause no benefit,
cause haughtiness, cause the lack of a calm mind, and the first becomes second,
second becomes third, or third becomes fourth (Note: this passage is unclear:
ekassa vā dutiyo hoti, dvinnaṃ vā tatiyo hoti, tiṇṇaṃ vā catuttho hoti). There
are a lot of obscene words, namely: talking about kings, about thieves,
ministers, army, fear, war, food, beverage, clothing, bedding, garland, smell,
kinship , cart ride, village, town, city, land, woman, (man theory,) hero,

these five desires, which five? (Those that) can be known (recognized) by the
eye, which makes for desire, want, greed for form; ...the ear... sound; nose...
smell; tongue... taste; body... touch; Bhikkhus! These are called the five
desires. Bhikkhus! All the happiness and joy that arise from these five desires,
bhikkhus! This is called lust, filthy happiness, ordinary people's happiness,
and non-sacred music. I said: 'It should not be practiced, it should not be

with skills: whether it is inspection, accounting, calculation, farming,
business, cattle grazing, governing, or other skills, he faces the cold and
heat, and the horsefly, the mosquito, wind, sun, and snakes, is contacted
(injured), and died of hunger and thirst, bhikkhus! This is called the fault of
desire, the directly visible accumulation of suffering, desire is the cause,
because of desire, desire is the cause.

Bhikkhus! If a virtuous man rises up, works hard, and fails to get wealth, he
will be sad, tired, weeping, pounding his chest and crying, and come to
confusion (and say): 'My rise is empty, and my efforts are fruitless." Bhikkhus!
This is called the fault of desire....

Bhikkhus! If a virtuous man gets wealth by rising up and working hard, he will
feel pain and worry in order to protect that wealth: 'How can (I make it so)
neither the king take my wealth, nor the thieves will take it, nor the fire will
burn it out, nor water flow (it) away, nor will the unlovable heirs take it
away?' When he guards and protects those wealth, or the king takes it, or the
thieves take it, or the fire burns, or the water runs (it) away, or the
unlovable heir takes it away, he is sad... (omitted) (and says): 'What I have no
longer exists.' Bhikkhus! This is called the fault of desire....

Besides, bhikkhus! Desire is the cause..., the king and the king theory (talking
about), the khattiya and the khattiya theory, the Brahman..., homeowner...,
mother and the son..., son and mother..., father and son..., son and father...,
brother and brother..., brother and sister..., sister and brother..., friend and
friend.... When they were quarrelling and arguing, they attacked each other with

and spears, drenched in cow dung, crushed by heavy objects, and beheaded by

called the fault of desire....

Besides, bhikkhus! Desire is the cause ..., they invaded people, took prey
(looting), robbed the way (robbery along the road), abducted wives, and after
the king captured him, he was punished with various punishments: flogging,
beating with stick, ...(omitted, see previous sections), ...where they suffer
death, or suffering like death. Bhikkhus! This is called the fault of desire....

Besides, bhikkhus! Desire is the cause..., do evil with the body, do evil with the
word, and do evil with the mind. He did evil deeds with his body and words, and
after he did evil with his mind, he was reborn into the suffering world, evil
interest, lower world, and hell after his death. Bhikkhus! This is called the
fault of desire, the suffering of later generations, desire is the cause,
because of desire, desire is the cause."

"After seeing the troubles in all kinds of desires": After seeing the troubles
in all kinds of desires, he saw, after seeing, after weighing, after judging,
after separating, after clarifying.

> 137 &middot; This is a disaster and tumor and scourge,  
Disease and arrow and terror for me,  
After seeing this horror in various desires,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"This is my calamity and tumor and scourge, disease and arrow and terror": This
was said by the Blessed One [AN.8.56]: "Bhikkhus! 'Terror,' this is synonymous
with desire; Bhikkhus! 'Suffering,' this is synonymous with desire;
...disease..., ...tumor..., the stab of an arrow, staining, mud (quagmire),
mother fetus (being born or reborn).... Why is 'terror' synonymous with
desire? Bhikkhus! Because those who are infected and bound by desire and greed
ill not be free from terror in their lives, and in the next life, they will not
be free from terror. Therefore, 'terror' is synonymous with desire. Bhikkhus!
Why is 'suffering'... 'disease'.... Bhikkhus! Because those who are tainted and
bound by desire and greed will not are not free from the mother's womb in (this)
life, and will not be free from the mother's womb in the next life, therefore,
this is a synonym for desire."

"Terror, suffering, disease, tumors,  
Piercing arrows and infection, the quagmire and the fetus,  
These are called desires, where most people are attached.  
They fell into a desirable state, then walked into the mother's womb,  
When a bhikkhu becomes a zealous person, he does not give up right knowledge.  
He conquered this obstacle and road like that,  
He observes these trembling people: those who have life and death."

"After seeing this horror in all kinds of desires," After seeing this horror in
all kinds of desires, he saw, after seeing, after weighing....

> 138 &middot; Heat and cold, hunger and thirst,  
And the wind, sun, fly, and snake,

> 139 &middot; As an elephant which up the herd,  
With a back like a lotus (spotted), outstanding,  
Will live in the forest as he likes,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Like an elephant (nāga; also meaning a noble person) after giving up the herd":
The elephant is called the elephant, and the one who is enlightened alone is
also the elephant. For what reason is the alone enlightened person an elephant?
"Don't commit a crime" is the elephant; "Don't go" is the elephant; "Don't come"
is the elephant. How is the single enlightened person "not committing crimes" as
an elephant? Crimes are called evil and unwholesome dhammas: those that are
polluted, that there are again (re-existing), there are fears, those that suffer
the consequences, and the ones that will die in the future.

"Do not commit any crimes in the world,  
After leaving all bonds and bondages,  
Those who don't stick to everything and are free,  
Like this are truly called elephants."

How is the single enlightened person "not going" as an elephant? The One
Enlightened One shouldn't do what he doesn't want to do; what he doesn't want to
do is not what he should do; he who doesn't go because of obsession should not
do what he should; don't go with anger; don't go because of ignorance; don't go
because of conceit; don't go because of seeing; don't go because of abandonment;
don't go because of doubt; don't go because of potential troubles; don't be
carried by quarrels, taken away, and moved.

How is the single enlightened person "not coming" as elephant? Any pollution
that is cut off by the Sotāpanna Path, those pollution he no longer experiences,
does not return, and does not go back; it is said that... (omitted) is not
returned... (omitted); all that pollution is cut off by the Arahant Path, he
will no longer experience, return, or go back to those pollutions.

"Like an elephant after abandoning the herd": For example, after the elephant
gives up and avoids the herd, it enters the woods, walks, lives, moves, goes on,
guards, and survives. Those who are alone in enlightenment also give up and
avoid the masses, and then they use the woods, wild forests, and border
dwellings (sitting places): low-noise, quiet, isolated atmosphere, alone,
suitable for sitting alone; he walks alone, stands alone, sits alone, lies
alone, enters the village alone for alms, advances alone, returns alone, sits
alone in a quiet place, performs alone, walks, lives alone, acts, goes on,
guards, and survives.

"The back is as the lotus flower, and outstanding": As the back of the elephant
has seven treasures or eight treasures, the one who is alone-enlightened has no
precept and prohibition learning accumulation, no concentration learning
accumulation, no wisdom learning accumulation, no liberation learning
accumulation, no perfect learning accumulation,; like the elephant with a lotus,
the one who is alone-enlightened also uses the flower of the seven branches of
enlightenment as the one with the lotus: mind as the flower of enlightenment,
the flower of enlightenment by choosing the Dhamma, ...with energy, ...with
happiness, tranquility, calmness. Like that. The head elephant is outstanding
with power (fortitude), with strength, with speed, and with courage. The one who
is alone with enlightenment is also such with precepts, with concentration, with
wisdom, with liberation, and liberation with wisdom.

"Will live in the wild (forest) as he likes": If the elephant lives in the wild
as he likes, so the Enlightened One lives in the wild as he likes: live in the
wild as he likes in the first jhāna; also with the second jhāna... (omitted),
also with the third jhāna..., and also with the fourth jhāna, to live in the
woods as he likes; also with compassion..., relief..., joy, peace of mind to
live in the woods as he likes; also to dwell in the boundless void, ...the
boundlessness of knowledge, ...nothingness, wait for extinction, for Fruit, to
live in the woods as you like.

> 140 &middot; It is impossible that those who are willing to meet (have company)  
Can reach (even) temporary relief,  
After listening to the words of (him of) the Sun tribe,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"It's impossible that those who are willing to meet (have company) can reach
(even) temporary relief": This is said by the Blessed One [MN.122]: "Ānanda,
indeed, everyone who is happy to have company, is better for having company,
likes to have company, specializes and enjoys gatherings, bhikkhus who are
better for gatherings and get joy in the gatherings will be those who are
free-willed, those who are not difficult, and those who do not have
difficulties, such as vitality, solitary, quiet, and enlightenment — this is
impossible. But, Ānanda, whichever bhikkhu lives alone, away from the group,
this should be expected: such a bhikkhu will be happy, lonely, quiet,
enlightened, etc. That kind of enjoyment, those who have no difficulty — this is
possible. Ānanda, indeed, everyone who enjoys gatherings, ...will enter and
dwell in an appeased, calmed, unshakable heart — this is impossible. But Ānanda,
whichever bhikkhus live alone and away from groups..., this should be expected:
such a bhikkhu will live in an appeased, calmed, unshakable heart — this is
possible."

"After listening to the words of the Sun tribe": The sun (ādicco) is called the
sun (sūriyo), his surname is Gotama, and the one who is enlightened is also the
surname of Gotama, and the one who is enlightened is a relative of the surname
of the sun and has kinship, so that single enlightened person is from the Sun
Clan. "After listening to the words of the Sun tribe": The words, ways of
speaking, teachings, explanations, admonitions of the Sun tribe, after hearing,
after grasping, understanding, and discerning.
