At the end of the verse, for those who live with the same intention, same
endeavor, same inclination, and same dwelling place as the Brāhmaṇas, the
distant dust and dhamma eyes of thousands of living things arise: "Any
collection of dhammas is an extinction." The mind of the Brāhmaṇa is free from
all defilements without clinging. Along with reaching the realm of the Arahant,
their sheepskin clothing, knotted hair, bark clothing, sticks, long-mouthed
water bottles, hair, and beards disappeared, becoming bald, replaced with robes,
cloth clothes, overcoats, and bowls. They clasp their hands together to show
respect to the Blessed One, and sit down: "Great Virtue! The Blessed One is my
teacher, and I am a disciple."
