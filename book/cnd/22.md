### Fourth Chapter

> 151 &middot; In terms of taste, not being a greedy person,  
A person who is not desiring, a person who does not nurture others,  
A second-time beggar (not skipping houses), not restrained to any family,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"In terms of taste, one who is not greedy or desiring": "Taste," there are root,
branch, skin, leaf, flower, fruit, sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty, alkaline,
astringent, pleasant, unpleasant, cold, and hot. Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas are
greedy for taste. They wander around for the best taste with their tongues.
After they get the sour taste, they ask for no sour taste, and ask for sourness
after getting no sourness; ...(omitted) sweetness ...(omitted); bitterness,
spicy, salty, alkali; when they get the sour taste, they look for the
astringency, when they get the astringency, look for the sour taste; ...pleasant
taste..., unpleasant...; ...unpleasant..., pleasant...; ...hot..., cold...;
...cold..., hot. They are greedy, craving, tied, fascinated, tainted, attached,
fixed, in the desire for taste, being obstructed. For the alone-enlightened
person, the taste and thirst and love have been cut off, ..., he eats food after
inspecting it logically: "Neither for pleasure, nor for intoxication, not for a
good figure, not for dignity, but for the survival of this body, to stop harm,
and to support the Brahma. In this way, I will repel the previous feelings, not
arouse new feelings, be healthy, without fault, and live in peace."

For example, if he applies oil to the sore, it is only for the purpose of
growing (flesh), or, if he applies oil to the axle, only for the purpose of
transporting goods, or, if he eats his son's meat it is only for the purpose of
passing through the desert. In the same way, the alone-enlightened person eats
food after introspection: "Neither for pleasure...." He is separated from the
craving of taste, quit, departed, left, been freed, and being unbound, he lives
with an unrestrained heart.

"Those who are not greedy," greed is called craving, which is greed, lust,
acquiescence, conformity, joy, desire, obsession, taking, contaminated,
disturbance, fraud, (reincarnation) root cause, (bitter) fertility, tailoring
(greed), net, river, bondage, rope, attachment, accumulation, companionship,
desire, intimate interaction, forest, jungle, love, expectation, relationship,
desire for form, desire for sounds, desire for smells, desire for tastes, desire
for touches, desire for acquisition, desire for wealth, desire for sons, desire
for life, the state of desire, hope, prayer, greedy appearance, possessing
greed, inquiring for profit, illegal greed, improper greed, hope, envy, desire
for desire, desire for nothingness, desire for form, formless thirst,
extinguished thirst, form thirst, sound thirst, smell thirst, taste thirst,
touch thirst, dhamma thirst, torrent, harness, binding, clinging, obstacles,
covering, defilements, potential trends of troubles, entanglement, vines,
stinginess, suffering roots, causes of suffering, occurrence of suffering,
magical nets, magical hooks, magical food, the realm of the devil, the residence
of the devil, the state of the devil, the bondage of the devil, the river of
thirst, the net of thirst, the rope of thirst, the sea of thirst, craving,
greed, and the root of unwholesomeness. That greed and thirst have been cut off
for the enlightened one, ..., therefore, the alone-enlightened ones are the ones
who are not greedy.

"Those who don't nurture other people, second-order beggars": "Those who don't
raise other people," For that alone-enlightened person, only nurture themselves,
not others.

"Those who do not nurture others, those who already know,  
Those who have been tamed, those who have settled in the core,  
Those who have exhausted their troubles and those who have eliminated their faults,  
I say he is a Brāhmaṇa."  
[Ud.6]

"Those who do not nurture others, second-time beggars": The alone-enlightened
person puts on his clothes in the early afternoon, takes the mantle, has guarded
his body, has guarded his words, has guarded his heart, and his mind has
emerged, with the protection of the roots, in order to enter a village or town
as a beggar, those who have their eyes down and behave adequately, go from home
to home without crossing to beg for alms.

"Do not be bound in the center of a family": the mind is bound in two ways:
making oneself humble, and others stand noble while the heart is bound, or
making others stand humble, and oneself stand noble and the heart is bound. How
to make yourself humble and make others stand up noble and flatter others?
(Thinking:) "You are very helpful to me, I rely on you to get clothes, food,
shelter, the needs of patients, medical necessities, and anyone who gives or
wants to do they think I am dependent on you, those who are regarded as you, all
my previous names from my parents have disappeared to me, because you are known
as those who frequent (someone's) home like that; those who often visit
(someone's) home." This is to make oneself humble, to make others stand noble,
and their hearts are bound.

How to make others humble and make oneself stand noble and be restrained?
(Thinking:) "I am a good person to you. Because of me, you turn to the Buddha,
to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha, become (as) those who are free from killing,
those who have not given and take, those who have not given, and those who are
free from lying, and those who (do not) drink spirits, fruit wine, and wine, I
will give you instructions, give me a lot of questions, I will explain uposatha,
and build temples. However, after you abandon me, you respect, honor, and revere
other people." This is to make others humble, and make oneself stand noble, and
the heart is bound. For those who pity for friends and confidants, their
interests are lost and the heart is bound.

"Do not be fettered in the center of one family": The mind of the
alone-enlightened person is not fettered by the obstacles of the family; the
heart is not fettered by the obstacles of the group (people); ...the residence;
...the clothes; ...group feeding; ...shelter; ...patient's needs and medical
necessities.

> 152 &middot; After giving up the five covers of the mind,

the aversion, to the alone-enlightened one, is cut off, severed, after
abandoning, after driving away, after finishing, making it come to
non-existence; there are those who do not adhere to the eyes, those who do not
adhere to the ears..., the unstuck, the unclinging, the person who does not turn
his heart toward (these things). He who has left, has departed, has been
liberated, has been separated from bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.

> 153 &middot; After putting aside happiness and suffering,  
And the joy and worry before (previously),  
After getting purity, peace, and calm,  
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

extinction of the joy and sorrow previously, enters and lives without suffering,

Those who are firm, hardworking, with fortitude and strength,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Those whose vitality has been activated for the gain of the highest interest":
The highest interest is called non-living, Nibbāna, which is the cessation of

Or,  
"I am willing to leave only skin, tendons, and bones;  
If the flesh and blood of the body is dried up,  
As long as people's perseverance, human strength,  
Human vitality, and human efforts should (persist)  
But (the goal is) not achieved,  
There will be no cessation of vitality."  
[SN.12.2]

"I will neither eat nor drink,  
Nor go out of my residence,  
Will not cause the thigh to fall (lying down),  
While the arrow of thirst is not be removed."  
[Thag.223]

"As long as my heart is not freed from the troubles by not clinging,  
I will not break this cross-legged (posture)!"  
[MN.32]

"As long as my mind is not free from the troubles with non-clinging, I will not
get up from this seat."

residence..., I will not go out from the half-roofed house..., the tall
building, the flat house, cave, hut, heavy pavilion, observation deck, round
house, shed, lecture hall, tent..., as long as my heart is not free from all
defilements without clinging, I will not go out from the tree."

"Just before this noon, I will obtain, fully obtain, attain, reach, and testify

does not shrink from his heart and who does not slacken his behavior. "Just at
noon... (omitted), in the evening..., before eating, after eating, before the
night, the night, after the night, at the time of death, at the time of the

> 155 &middot; Those who sit alone, do not ignore jhāna,  
And always follow the Dhamma,  
Having explored the misery in existence,  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Sit alone, do not ignore jhāna": The alone-enlightened person is a person who
is willing to sit alone, a person who loves to sit alone, and a practitioner of
inner cessation, does not despise jhāna, has the observer, and increases the
vacant house, the meditator, the jhāna-loving person, the singular practitioner,
and the admirer of their own interests, are those who sit alone. "Do not ignore
jhāna," the one who is enlightened in two ways doesn't neglect jhāna: for the
emergence of the first jhāna that has not arisen, to become harnessed, strongly
harnessed, fully harnessed; or the second jhāna..., or the third jhāna..., or

"I have explored the misery in all existence": "All actions are impermanent,"
..., "all actions are suffering"..., "all dhammas are selfless"..., "any
collection of dhammas is an extinction of dhammas." I have probed misery in all
being.

> 156 &middot; Those who wish for the extermination of love, those who do not let go,  
Those who are wise, those who learn more, those who have mindfulness,  
The perceiver, decider, and diligent one of the Dhamma  
Should walk alone like a rhinoceros.

"Hope for the extinction of the thirst for love, the one who does not let go":

has been heard, all that which has goodness in the beginning, goodness in the
middle, and goodness in the end; correct meaning and correct words, proclaiming
that there is only a complete and pure Brāhmaṇa Dhamma. Such Dhamma has been
heard, remembered, recited, observed with the heart, and penetrated by seeing
the good. "Those who have mindfulness" are the one who is alone-enlightened, and
have the highest level of thought and intelligence. They are the memorizers and
recallers who did it a long time ago and said it a long time ago.

the measurer of the Dhamma, the judge of the Dhamma, the clearer of the Dhamma:
"all actions are impermanent," ...the clearer of the Dhamma. Or, for the
alone-enlightened one, he is the enlightened person of the realm, the
enlightened person of the place, the enlightened person of the interest, the
enlightened person of the rebirth, the enlightened person of the revolving, the
enlightened person of being, the enlightened person of rotation, the enlightened
person of reincarnation. Or, the one who is enlightened is the one who lives in
the ultimate (boundary), the one who lives in the world, the one who lives in
the ultimate, the one who lives in the ultimate place of interest, the one who
lives in the final life, the one who stands at the end of the incarnation, the
one who stands at the end, the one who stands at the end of reincarnation, the
one who stands at the end of the cycle, the one who stands at the end, those who
gather (the last body) at the end, those who hold the last self-enlightenment.

"This is his last, this is the last gathering (body),  
The cycle of life and death, without his rebirth."

For this reason, the enlightened person is the perceiver of the Dhamma. The
"decider," the Four Holy Paths are called the decision, and the "one with the
Four Holy Paths" is the decider. He has reached, fully reached, arrived, and has
given testimony to the decision. "Diligence," diligence is called vitality,
which is the stimulation of the vitality of the heart, diligence, hard work,
