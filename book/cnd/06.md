32. (Dhotaka:) I see a Brahman owning nothing in the world of heaven and the
    world of mean,
I salute you, all-seeing one, Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubts.

"I see in heaven and the world of men": "Heaven," there are three kinds of
heaven: secular heaven, reborn heaven, and pure heaven. What is secular heaven?
Kings and princes and queens are called secular heavens. What is the rebirth?
The Four Kings, Thirty-Three Heavens, night days, day of the day, free days
(??), all Brahma heavens, and all the heavens above that are called Rebirth
Heavens. What is pure heaven? The troubles of the disciples of the Tathāgata,
Arahants, and Paccekabuddhas, have been exhausted, this is called pure heavens.
The Blessed One is the heaven of the secular and the departed heaven (??), the
heaven of the pure heaven, the victorious heaven, the heaven among the heaven,
the lion among the lions, the dragon among the dragons, the lord among the
lords, the muni among the munis, the king among the kings. "I see in the heavens
and in the world of man": In the world of man I see the heavens (??); I see the
superior heaven; I see the heaven in the heaven, I see, I watch, I meditate, I
observe.

"Brahman actors (doers) without possessions": "No," no greed, no hatred,
...ignorance, sloth, seeing (sight), pollution, evil deeds; any of those who
treat the Buddha (for Buddha??) and the world (??), it has been cut off, and the
roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming
non-existent and immortal for the future. Therefore, the Buddha is called no
owner (not owner of these things??). "Brahman," the Blessed One is the Seven
Dhammas, the excluded state is Brahman (the Blessed One is the excluded state of
the seven dhammas of Brahmin ??): seeing is excluded, suspicion is excluded,
abstinence.., greed..., aversion, ignorance, sloth, and those evil and
unwholesome dhammas are excluded: those that are polluted, there are again.
People who are fearful, who suffer the consequences, and will die in the future.

Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 524]

"After all evil is eliminated, the state where the decontaminated good enters
the concentration standing (dwelling),
He transcends samsara and becomes a consummation (hero??). Those who are not dependent,
like this can be called a Brahman."

"Actor," walker, doer, dweller, on-goer, guardian, and survivor.

"I respect you, all-seeing one": "You," he said the world-honored. "I
respect," I respect with my body, or I respect with words, or I respect with my
heart, or I respect in its meaning, or I follow the Dhamma to show respect,
salute . "All eyes," all eyes are called the state of all knowing wisdom. The
Blessed One arrives (has) (??), the state of intelligence of fully reaching
(having), entering, fully entering, having enough, having all the knowledge.

"For him, there is nothing unseen here (in this world),
There is no knowledge that cannot be known,
He proves that everything that exists should be guided by inference,
Because the Tathāgata, like that, is all-eyes."
[Ps.1]

"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubts": "Sakyamuni," Sakyamuni is a bhikkhu from
the house of Sakya. This is Sakyamuni. Or, "the rich, the wealthy." This is
also Sakya. For him there are these wealth, namely: trusting wealth, abstaining
from wealth, ashamed of wealth, hearing about wealth, giving wealth, wisdom
wealth, mindfulness of wealth, righteous wealth, divine wealth, root wealth,
strength wealth, enlightenment wealth, Path wealth, Fruit wealth, Nibbāna
wealth, and use these various treasures as (for??) the rich, the wealthy. Or,
"Those who are possible, those who are able, those who flow out all kinds of
things, those who are sufficient, those who are heroes, those who are brave,
those who are heroic, those who are not timid, those who are not frightened,
those who do not run away, those who have given up fear of fear, those who have
given up terror and fear." Doubts are called doubts: doubt on suffering, doubt
on the path leading to suffering, doubt on the foreground, doubt on the
background, doubt in the context of the context (??), the doubt in the specific
conditional condition (??), such doubts, suspicions, doubtful states, confusion,
hesitation, crossroads, inconsistent grasping, hesitating, incomplete
understanding, stiff state, confusion of mind. "Sakyamuni! Please free me from
doubt": Please free me; please release me; pull me out; please pull me out
completely; bring me out of doubt.

33. (The Blessed One:) I will not be able to liberate, Dhotaka, anyone who
    doubts in the world,
When you know the best Dhamma, then you will get through this storm.

"I will not be able to liberate": You, I will not be able to release, free,
make liberated, pull out, pull out completely, make to ascend, make to fully
ascend, in a doubtful arrow state (of being struck with the arrow of doubt??).
Or, I don't work hard on the unbelievers, on the unwilling, on the slack, on
those with inferior vitality, on the inactive; I don't do my best; I don't
strive; I don't do with valor; I don't work with enthusiasm; I don't make
fortitude; I don't make determination; I don't make vitality; I don't make it
produce; I don't make it appear; I don't make it fully produced; I don't make it
arise; I don't make it give birth to the teachings of the Dhamma. Or, You
don't have any other liberators. Those who can be liberated use their own
fortitude, with their own energy, with their own striving, with their own brave
efforts, with their own power, with their own human power, with their own human
vitality, with their own work, with their own correct way of doing, following
the path, not going the opposite way, the way of following the Dhamma, and the
way of doing the Dhamma, they can be freed.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Cunda! 'I am the one who has fallen into the
quagmire and will pull out the other people who have fallen into the quagmire.'
This is impossible. Cunda! 'I am an unregulated, untrained, non-Nibbāna one. I
will make others tune, train, and attain Nibbāna.' This is impossible." [MN.8]

This is said by the Blessed One: [Dph.12,165]
"He has done evil, he is polluted,
He who does do not do evil, he comes pure,
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure."

This was also said by the Blessed One: "Similarly, Brahmin! Nibbāna stays and
stands, which leads to the way of Nibbāna stays and stands (?? Nibbāna lived,
guided by the way of Nibbāna??). My persuasion stays (My advice to live??).
However, when my disciples are taught and admonished in this way, some of them
have reached the ultimate end Nibbāna, but some will not arrive, Brahmin! What
can I do here? Brahmin! Tathāgata is the waypointer. [MN.107] Buddha only tells
(guides) the way, and they can be liberated when they practice it by
themselves.

"Any doubter in the world": A doubter, a person who has doubts, confusion, and
hesitation. "Any (person)," any khattiya, or brāhmaṇa, or vessa, or sudda, or

through.

of seeing, the ignorant, you can get through, you can surpass, you can you can

34. (Dhotaka:) Brahman! I ask, out of compassion, teach me the Dhamma of
    seclusion,
(So that) As the void (space) is not bound, here I can walk silently and
    unrestrained.

know," I can know, dissociate (??), know for sure, understand, prove, reach, and
testify.

"As the void (space) is not bound": As the void is not stuck, not captured, not
bound, not tied to the world, then it is the one who is not stuck, not captured,
and not tied, the one who is not all-bound. (Or,) As the emptiness is not dyed
with carmine, or golden yellow, or indigo, or deep red, then the one who is not
dyed (stained), the one who is not angry, the one who does not change foolishly,
and the one who does not pollute. If the void does not get angry, is not
abusive, does not resist, and is not attacked, this is the one who is not angry,
the one who is not abusive, the one who does not resist, the one who is not
attacked, and the one who does not fight back.

seeing... (omitted). After the dependence of love has been cut off, and the
dependence of seeing has been cut off, one becomes non-dependant on the eyes,
...the ear..., the nose, tongue, body, mind, forms, sounds, smells, tastes,
touches, dhammas, family, group, residence, gain, reputation, praise, clothes,
food, dwelling, (patient's needs and medical necessities), the Desire Realm, The
Formed Realm, The Formless Realm, the desire to be, the desire for the formless,
the desire to have, to exist, one aggregate, four aggregates, five aggregates,

not adhere to, those who do not fall into, those who do not turn their minds
towards, those who have left, have given up, have been freed, have been
separated from the bondage, living with a restrained heart. "Can do" can live,
can act, can go on, can guard, can survive.

35. [Blessed One: "Dhotaka!"] I will tell you about the stillness, known in
    (real) life rather than (through) rumor,
