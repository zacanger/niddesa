> 32 &middot; (Dhotaka:) I see a Brahman owning nothing  
In the world of heaven and the world of men,  
I salute you, all-seeing one, Sakyamuni!  
Please free me from doubts.

"I see, in heaven and the world of men": "Heaven," there are three kinds of
heaven: general (secular, worldly) heaven, rebirth heaven, and pure heaven. What
is secular heaven? Kings and princes and queens are called secular heavens. What
is the rebirth? The four great god kings, the realm of the thirty-three gods,
Tusita heaven, dust-day god heaven, all Brahma heavens, and all the heavens
above that are called Rebirth Heavens. What is pure heaven? The troubles of the
disciples of the Tathāgata, Arahants, and Paccekabuddhas, have been exhausted,
this is called pure heavens. The Blessed One is of the general heaven, the
rebirth heaven, the pure heaven, and the victorious heaven, the heaven among the
heaven, the lion among the lions, the dragon among the dragons, the lord among
the lords, the muni among the munis, the king among the kings. "I see in the
heavens and in the world of man": In the world of man and the heavens, I see; I
see the superior heaven; I see the heaven in the heaven, I see, I watch, I
meditate, I observe.

"Brahman actors (doers) without possessions": "No," no greed, no hatred,
...ignorance, sloth, seeing (sight), pollution, evil deeds; any of these, for
the Blessed One, it has been cut off, and the roots have been cut off, just like
a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and immortal for the future.
Therefore, the Buddha is called the non-owner. "Brahman," the Blessed One is the
one in the state of excluding the seven dhammas: seeing is excluded, suspicion
is excluded, abstinence.., greed..., aversion, ignorance, sloth, and those evil
and unwholesome dhammas are excluded: those that are polluted, there are again.
People who are fearful, who suffer the consequences, and will die in the future.

The Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 524]

"After all evil is eliminated,  
The state where the decontaminated good enters the concentration standing (dwelling),  
He transcends samsara and becomes consummate.  
Those who are not dependent, like this can be called a Brāhmaṇa."

"Actor," walker, doer, dweller, on-goer, guardian, and survivor.

"I respect you, all-seeing one": "You," he said the world-honored. "I respect,"
I respect with my body, or I respect with words, or I respect with my heart, or
I respect in its meaning, or I follow the Dhamma to show respect, salute .
"All-seeing," all-eyes are called the state of all knowing wisdom. The Blessed
One has the state of intelligence, of fully having, entering, fully entering,
sufficiently having, having all the knowledge.

"For him, there is nothing unseen here (in this world),  
There is no knowledge that cannot be known,  
He proves that everything that exists should be guided by inference,  
Because the Tathāgata, like that, is all-eyes."
[Ps.1]

"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubts": "Sakyamuni," Sakyamuni is a bhikkhu
from the house of Sakya. This is Sakyamuni. Or, "the rich, the wealthy." This is
also Sakya. For him there are these wealth, namely: trusting wealth, abstaining
from wealth, ashamed of wealth, hearing about wealth, giving wealth, wisdom
wealth, mindfulness of wealth, righteous wealth, divine wealth, root wealth,
strength wealth, enlightenment wealth, Path wealth, Fruit wealth, Nibbāna
wealth, and use these various treasures as the rich, the wealthy. Or, "Those who
are possible, those who are able, those who flow out all kinds of things, those
who are sufficient, those who are heroes, those who are brave, those who are
heroic, those who are not timid, those who are not frightened, those who do not
run away, those who have given up fear of fear, those who have given up terror
and fear." Doubts are called doubts: doubt on suffering, doubt on the path
leading to suffering, doubt of the future, doubt of the past, doubt of the
future and the past, doubt of causal connections, such doubts, suspicions,
doubtful states, confusion, hesitation, crossroads, inconsistent grasping,
hesitating, incomplete understanding, stiff state, confusion of mind.
"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubt": Please free me; please release me; pull
me out; please pull me out completely; bring me out of doubt.

> 33 &middot; (The Blessed One:) I will not be able to liberate, Dhotaka,  
Anyone who doubts in the world,  
When you know the best Dhamma,  
Then you will get through this storm.

"I will not be able to liberate": You, I will not be able to release, free, make
liberated, pull out, pull out completely, make to ascend, make to fully ascend,
in a being struck by the arrow of doubt. Or, I don't work hard on the
unbelievers, on the unwilling, on the slack, on those with inferior vitality, on
the inactive; I don't do my best; I don't strive; I don't do with valor; I don't
work with enthusiasm; I don't make fortitude; I don't make determination; I
don't make vitality; I don't make it produce; I don't make it appear; I don't
make it fully produced; I don't make it arise; I don't make it give birth to the
teachings of the Dhamma. Or, you don't have any other liberators. Those who can
be liberated use their own fortitude, with their own energy, with their own
striving, with their own brave efforts, with their own power, with their own
human power, with their own human vitality, with their own work, with their own
correct way of doing, following the path, not going the opposite way, the way of
following the Dhamma, and the way of doing the Dhamma, they can be freed.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Cunda! 'I am the one who has fallen into the
quagmire and will pull out the other people who have fallen into the quagmire.'
This is impossible. Cunda! 'I am an unregulated, untrained, non-Nibbāna one. I
will make others tune, train, and attain Nibbāna.' This is impossible." [MN.8]

This is said by the Blessed One: [Dph.12,165]  
"He has done evil, he is polluted,  
He who does do not do evil, he comes pure,  
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure."

This was also said by the Blessed One: "Similarly, Brahman, Nibbāna stays and
abides, the path which leads to Nibbāna stays and abides, and my persuasion
(teaching) stays and abides. However, when my disciples are taught and
admonished in this way, some of them reach the ultimate end of Nibbāna, and some
do not reach. Brahmin, What can I do here? Brahman, The Tathāgata is the guide.
[MN.107] The Buddha only told (directed) the way, and when they practice it by
themselves, they could be free."

"Any doubter in the world": A doubter, a person who has doubts, confusion, and
hesitation. "Any (person)," any khattiya, or brāhmaṇa, or vessa, or sudda, or
layman, or bhikkhu, or heaven, or person. "In the world," in the world of the
suffering world... (omitted).

"When knowing the most triumphant Dhamma": The highest Dhamma is called
immortality, Nibbāna, which is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of
all attachments, the cessation of craving, greed, extinguishment, and Nibbāna.

the most advanced method; when knowing, distinguishing, understanding,
through.

of seeing, the ignorant, you can get through, you can surpass, you can you can
overcome the storm.

> 34 &middot; (Dhotaka:) Brahman! I ask, out of compassion,

(So that) as the void (space) is not bound,  
Here I can walk silently and unrestrained.

know," I can know, discern, know for sure, understand, prove, reach, and

"As the void (space) is not bound": As the void is not stuck, not captured, not
bound, not tied to the world, then it is the one who is not stuck, not captured,
and not tied, the one who is not all-bound. (Or,) as the emptiness is not dyed
with carmine, or golden yellow, or indigo, or deep red, then the one who is not
dyed (stained), the one who is not angry, the one who does not change foolishly,
and the one who does not pollute. If the void does not get angry, is not
abusive, does not resist, and is not attacked, this is the one who is not angry,
the one who is not abusive, the one who does not resist, the one who is not
attacked, and the one who does not fight back.

seeing... (omitted). After the dependence of love has been cut off, and the
dependence of seeing has been cut off, one becomes non-dependant on the eyes,
...the ear..., the nose, tongue, body, mind, forms, sounds, smells, tastes,
touches, dhammas, family, group, residence, gain, reputation, praise, clothes,
food, dwelling, (patient's needs and medical necessities), the Desire Realm, The
Formed Realm, The Formless Realm, the desire to be, the desire for the formless,
the desire to have, to exist, one aggregate, four aggregates, five aggregates,

not adhere to, those who do not fall into, those who do not turn their minds
towards, those who have left, have given up, have been freed, have been
separated from the bondage, living with an unrestrained heart. "Can do" can
live, can act, can go on, can guard, can survive.
