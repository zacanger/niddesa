### 1. Punṇạka

> 12 &middot; [Venerable Punṇạka like this:]  
To the one who is undisturbed, the seer of the roots,  
I come with questions in need,  
For what cause do the many rishis, people, khattiyas, and Brāhmaṇas  
Make sacrifices in the world here?  
Blessed One, I ask you, please tell me this.

"The one who is not disturbed, the one who sees the root": "Disturbance is
called craving, that is greed, ...(omitted, see previous sections)..., and
unwholesome roots. For the Buddhas and the Blessed One, that disturbance is cut
off, the root has been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming
non-existent, a non-living thing for the future, so the Buddha is the
undisturbed. In the disturbed state of disconnection, the Blessed One does not
waver; does not shake when he does not get it (obtain something); does not shake
when he has reputation; does not shake when he has no reputation; does not shake
with praise; does not shake with reprimand; does not shake at times; does not
shake, does not move, does not tremble. "The one who sees the root," the Blessed
One sees the roots, is the seer of the cause, seer of the origin, seer of the
abiding (origin), seer of the nutriment, seer of the object, seer of the
condition, seer of the set of views.

There are three unwholesome roots: the unwholesome root of greed, of aversion,
and of ignorance.

This was said by the Blessed One: Bhikkhus! There are causes and conditions for
these three kamma gatherings; which three are there? Greed is the cause and
condition of kamma, hatred is the cause and condition of kamma, and delusion is
the cause and condition of kamma. Bhikkhus! It's not because of greed, hatred,
or delusion that the heavens are known, people are known, or any good interests
are known, bhikkhus! But because of greed, hatred, and delusion, the hell world
is known, the animal world is known, the hungry ghost world is known, or any
other evil interest [AN.6.39]; individuals in hell, the animal world, and the
hungry ghost world are known. These three unwholesome roots, the Blessed One
knows and sees, and so so Blessed One is the seer of the root... (omitted).
There are three good roots: the good root of no greed, of no hatred, and of no
delusion.

This was said by the Blessed One: Bhikkhus! There are these three... (omitted)
bhikkhus! It's not that the hell of no greed, no hatred, no delusion is known,
the animal world is known, the hungry ghost world is known, or any evil
interests are known, bhikkhus! But without greed, without hatred, without
delusion, heaven is known, man is known, or any good interest: those in heaven
and the world arise and are known. The Blessed One knows and sees the three good
roots, so the Blessed One is the seer of the root....

This was said by the Blessed One: Bhikkhus! Any unwholesome Dhamma, unwholesome
division, unwholesome faction [AN.1.56], all that is rooted in ignorance,
converged in ignorance, and eradicated with ignorance, all that will be
eradicated. [SN.20.1] The Blessed One knows and sees....

This was said by the Blessed One: Bhikkhus! Any good dhamma, good division, and
good faction [AN.1.57], rooted in non-relaxation, and unbridled as reunion, this
is said to be the number one among those dhammas. [SN.45.139] The Blessed One
knows and sees....

Or, the Blessed One knows and sees: Ignorance is the root of action, action is
the root of consciousness, consciousness is the root of name and form, name and
form are the roots of six sense bases, the six sense bases are the roots of
contact, contact is the root of sensation, sensation is the root of craving,
craving is the root of clinging, clinging the root of becoming, becoming is the
root of birth, and birth is the root of old age (and death). The Blessed One
knows and sees....

Or, the Blessed One knows and sees: The eye is the root of eye disease, the ear
is the root of ear disease, the nose..., the tongue..., the body..., and the
mind is the root of suffering. The Blessed One knows and sees....

"[Like this Venerable Punṇạka]": "Like this," the continuation of the
sentence... (omitted, see previous sections). Venerable Punṇạka ...(omitted, see
previous sections).

"The ones in need come with questions": I come with questions as needed, I come
if I want to ask questions, I come if I want to hear questions, the needy come
with questions. Or, the inquirers of the question have the need, the one who
wants to ask the question, the one who wants to hear, the needy (will) come,
approach, visit. Or, when you have a question, you can and you have enough
reason to tell and answer the question I asked, "Please bear this burden."

"People who rely, rishis": Rely on, stick to, enter, or turn their hearts toward
something. "Rishis," who are named immortals, and whichever bhikkhus become
hermits. "People" are called human beings.

"Khattiyas, Brāhmaṇas, to the gods": "Khattiyas," everything that is born of
khattiya. "Brāhmaṇas," whoever calls others gentlemen. "To the gods," other
ascetics (ājīvakā) to their god (devatā), Jains to their god, matted-hair
ascetics to their god, wandering mendicants to their god, the exiled god..., the
elephant god..., horse god, bull god, dog god, crow god, Vishnu god, the power
of the power ring-keeper, the man of the virtuous ring, the jewel of the
virtuous ring, the fire..., the dragon .., the golden-winged..., Yakkha, Asura,
Gandhabba, the great king god of the guard (heaven), the moon god, sun god,
Indra, Brahma.... Those who are worthy of offering to them are their gods.

"There are many sacrifices in the world": "Sacrifice" is called a donation:
clothing, food, shelter, necessities for patients, medical necessities, food,
drink, cloth, transportation, garlands, spices, oils, bed, house, lamps and
candles. "As a sacrifice," wherever they seek, pursue, and beg for clothing,
food (omitted) ...are used as sacrifices; wherever they prepare clothing, food
...are also used as sacrifices; wherever they give, provide, and donate
clothing, food ...also make sacrifices. "Many," these sacrifices are many, or
the priests of these sacrifices are many, or there are many worthy providers.
How are there sacrifices many? The clothes, food ...belong to many, so these
sacrifices are many.

How is it that there are many priests of these sacrifices? There are many
priests of these sacrifices: khattiya, Brāhmaṇa, vessa, sudda, laymen, bhikkhus,
heavens, and people, so there are many priests of these sacrifices.

How is or are there many worthwhile providers? There are many Samaṇas,
Brāhmaṇas, beggars, travelers, wanderers, and beggars, so there are many worthy
of offering. "Here is in the world," in the human world.

"Blessed One, I ask you, please tell me": "Asking," there are three kinds of
inquiry: inquiry about the explanation of the unseen, inquiry about the
confluence of the seen, and inquiry about the cutting off of doubt.

What is an inquiry about the unseen? The unknown, unseen, unmeasured, unjudged,
unclear characteristic, for the purpose of his wisdom, seeing, measuring,
judging, making clear, he asked a question.

What is an inquiry about the confluence of the seen? A characteristic that was
known, seen, measured, judged, clear, and understood. He asked questions for the
purpose of confluence with other wise men.

What is an inquiry for the cutting off of doubt? A leap-into skeptic, jump-in
doubter, and born doubter: "Is that so? Isn't it true? What is it then? How is
it?" He asks questions for the purpose of severance of doubt.

The next three kinds of inquiry: human inquiry, non-human inquiry, and inquiry
of the created (nimmitapucchā).

What is a human inquiry? People asked questions after they went to see the
Buddha, the Blessed One: bhikkhus, upāsakas, upāsikās, kings, khattiya,
Brāhmaṇas, vessas, suddas, lay people, monastics.

What is an inhuman inquiry? The non-people asked questions after they went to
see the Buddha, Blessed One: the dragons, golden-winged birds, Yakkha, Asuras,
Gandhabba, kings, Indra, Brahmas, devas.

What is the inquiry of the created? All the physical bodies and limbs of the
Blessed One's mind-made forms draw near and ask questions after seeing the
Blessed One, and the Blessed One answers him.

The next three kinds of inquiry: inquiry for one's own benefit, inquiry for the
benefit of others, and inquiry for the benefit of both. The next three:
inquiries about current interests, inquiries about future interests, and
inquiries about the highest interests. The next three: inquiry for the benefit
of no faults, inquiry for the benefit of no pollution, and inquiry for the pure
benefit. The next three: (about) past queries, future queries, and current
queries. The next three: (about) inquiries within oneself, inquiries outside
oneself, and inquiries within and outside oneself. The next three: (about) good
merit, demerit, and the undesignated (abyākatapucchā) The next three: (about)
masses, relics, and institutions. The next three: about mindfulness, about
diligence, about spiritual content. The next three: about the root, the
strength, and the enlightenment. The next three: about the Path, the Fruit, and
Nibbāna.

After considering the upper and lower in the world,  
Without anywhere wavering in the world,  
Quiet, without smoke, without worries, without desires,  
I say he has lived through birth and aging.  
[AN.3.32]

"Considering the upper and lower in the world": After consideration, it is
called wisdom, understanding... (omitted, see previous sections) no delusion,
choice of dhamma, right view. "Upper and lower," the lower part is called one's
own individual, and the upper part is called other individuals; the lower part
is called one's own physical perception, thinking, and consciousness; the upper
part is called other people's physical consciousness; the upper is called the
six outer places; the lower is called the world of humans, the upper is called
the world of heaven; the lower is called the world of desire, the upper is
called the realm of material, and the world of formlessness; the lower is called
the world of desire and material, the world is called the formless world.
"Considering the upper and lower in the world": Considering the upper and lower
as impermanent, suffering, illness, sick... (omitted) after leaving, after he
considers, knows, understands, weighs, judges, after separation, after
clarification.

"[The Blessed One: 'Punṇạka']": "Punṇạka," the Blessed One calls that Brāhmaṇa
by his name. "Blessed One," ....

"For him, there is no wavering in the world": "For him," the Arahant, the one
who has exhausted troubles. "Wavering," of craving, of seeing, of conceit, of
pollution, the shaking of desire; for him, they do not exist, are not known, are
not found, they have been cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, burned
by the fire of wisdom. "Anywhere," no matter where, inside or outside or inside
and outside. "In the world," ....

"Silent, smokeless, without distress, without desire, I say that he has survived
'birth and aging'": "Silent," the state of silenced greed, ...aversion,
...ignorance, anger, resentment, hiding of evil, all unwholesome actions;
silent, calmed down, extinguished, cooled, departed, and ceased. "Smokeless,"
the evil deeds of the body are smokeless, destroyed, dried up, withered, and
eliminated; evil deeds of speech... (omitted); of the mind; greed; anger;
ignorance; resentment; of hiding evil; of envy; of stinginess; of cunning;
passion; sloth; torpor; idleness; all pollution; all evils; all afflictions; all
scorching heat (torment); all bad deeds are smokeless, destroyed, withered, have
been wiped out. Or, anger is called smoke:

"Brāhmaṇa! Conceit is indeed your burden,  
Anger is your smoke, and lies are your grey (ashes).  
The tongue is the ladle for sacrifice, the heart is the furnace for sacrifice,  
And the self that is well-tuned is the fire of men."  
[SN.7.9]

Or, anger is aroused in ten forms: "He has been unfavorable to me," [AN.9.29]
anger is aroused; "he is unfavorable to me," anger is aroused; "he will be
unfavorable to me," ...(omitted); "he has been against what I love and desire to
do," "he is against what I love and desire to do," "he will be...," "he has been
in favor of what I do not love and do not desire to do," "he is in favor," "he
will be in favor," anger is aroused; or anger is aroused in an unreasonable
place. Any kind of anger, hostility, hatred, aversion, evil, heart aversion,
arrogance, aggression, rage, displeasure: this is called anger.

In addition, the extreme and small states of anger should be perceived:
sometimes anger is only to the degree of turbidity, but not as much as frowning;
sometimes anger is just to the degree of, but not as much as gritting teeth;
sometimes ...gritted teeth, but not ...verbal abuse; sometimes verbal abuse, but
not looking around for a weapon; sometimes looking for a weapon but not enough
to take up a weapon; sometimes enough to acquire the weapon, but not enough to
pull out the rod; sometimes pulling out the rod, but not striking the rod;
sometimes striking a blow, but not fracturing; sometimes fracturing, but not
enough to rupture; sometimes rupturing, but not pulling limbs; sometimes pulling
limbs apart, but not enough to kill; sometimes enough to kill, but not not
enough to abandon himself. When the angry person kills himself after killing
others, this is such that the anger reaches the increase, and the further
reaches the increase. For him whose anger is cut off, calmed down..., he is
called smokeless.

The state where anger has been cut off is smokeless; the state where anger has
been known is smokeless; anger is smokeless because it has been known; anger
that has been severed is smokeless. "No distress," greed is distress, anger is
distress, ignorance is distress, ...(omitted), all unwholesome deeds are
distress. For him, who has cut off..., he is the who has with no distress.

"No desire," desire is called craving, that is greed, lust... (omitted),
unwholesome roots. For him who this desire is cut off..., he is called the one
who has no desire. "Birth": Among all living beings, of each kind of birth,
entry into (the womb), manifestation of various aggregates, and attainment of
each kind of sentient being. "Aging": Among all living beings, about the aging,
tooth loss, hair whitening, wrinkles, declining life span, and degeneration of
the roots of each kind of living beings. "For those who are silent, smokeless,
without distress, and without desire, I say that he has survived 'birth and
aging'": Anyone who is silent, smokeless, without distress, and without desire;
birth, aging, and dying have been overcome, transcended, passed, crossed; I say,
I explain, I teach, I inform, I build, I uncover, I parse, I clarify.
