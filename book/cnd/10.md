### 10. Kappa

> 61 &middot; [Venerable Kappa like this:]  
For those who stand in the flow,  
When the great terror of the flood has arisen,  
For those tortured by aging and death,  
Please tell me about an island, dear sir!  
Please tell me about the island,  
So that there will be no more, subsequently.

"Those standing in the flow": The flow is called reincarnation: coming, going,
coming and going, going to death, all kinds of death, rebirth, birth,
disintegration, birth, aging, death. The beginning of reincarnation is not known
[SN.15.1], and the end is not known. Just in the middle of saṃsāra, sentient
beings are abiding, stopped, stuck, entered, stained, and turned toward.

How is the starting point of reincarnation unknown? "Only this kind of birth
cycle revolves, and then does not revolve." This is not the case, so the
starting point of reincarnation is not known. "Only such a hundred births
revolved around, but not afterwards." ...(omitted). "Only such a thousand births
revolved around...." Only these hundreds of thousands of births...." "Only these
tens of thousands of births...." "Only such tens of millions of birth...." This
is indeed not the case, so the starting point of reincarnation is not known.
"Thousands of births like this revolved around, but didn't revolve
afterwards..." "Only such tens of thousands of births revolve around, but not
afterwards." This is indeed also not the case, so the starting point of
reincarnation is not known.

"Only this one year, it turns around, and then it doesn't turn around." This is
indeed also not the case, so the starting point of reincarnation is not known.
"Only this one-hundred-year cycle.... Only this millennium cycle started....
Only this one hundred thousand years.... Only These tens of thousands of
years.... Only such a cycle of tens of millions of years.... Only such a cycle
of thousands of years.... Only these tens of thousands of years have turned
around, and then they won't." This is indeed also not the case, hence the
starting point of reincarnation is not known.

"Only this kind of catastrophe revolved around, but not afterwards." This is
indeed not the case, this is also "the starting point of reincarnation is not
known". "Only this kind of hundred tribulations.... Only such a thousand
tribulations.... Only the cycle of hundred and thousand tribulations.... Only
this kind of tens of thousands of calamities.... Only the tens of millions of
calamities.... Only the tens of thousands of tribulations have revolved around,
and then they won't." This is indeed also not the case, hence the starting point
of reincarnation is not known.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! Saṃsāra has no beginning. The
starting point of the circulation and reincarnation of the sentient beings
covered by ignorance and craving is unknown. ...Bhikkhus! (You) have experienced
hardship for so long, experienced heaviness, experienced misfortune, and
increased cemeteries, bhikkhus! At this point, it is enough to get discontented
with everything! Enough to leave the tie! Enough for relief!" [SN.15.1] This
also on the starting point of reincarnation.

How is the end of reincarnation unknown? "Only this birth cycle will rotate, and
thereafter it will not rotate." This is indeed not the case, this is "the end of
reincarnation is not known." "Only such a hundred births... Only such a thousand
births... Only such a hundred thousand births... Only such a million births...
Only such a thousand births... Only such tens of thousands of births... Only
such a year... Only such a hundred years... Only such a millennium wheel... Only
such a hundred thousand years... Only such a thousand years... Only these
hundreds of thousands of years... Only such thousands of years... Only such
hundreds of thousands of thousands of years... Only such a catastrophe... Only
such a hundred calamities... Only such a thousand calamities... Only such a
hundred thousands of tribulations... Only such tens of thousands of tribulations
will revolve, and will not revolve afterwards." This is indeed not the case,
this is also "the end of reincarnation is not known." In this way, the starting
point of saṃsāra is not known, and the end of saṃsāra is not known. Just in the
middle of saṃsāra, sentient beings are abiding, stopped, stuck, entered,
stained, and turned their hearts toward them.

"When the great terror of the flood is arising": When the exposure of desire,
the exposure of being, the exposure of seeing, and the exposure of ignorance are
arising, being produced, being born, being generated, and being presented; the
great horror, the horror in life, the horror in age, the horror in sickness, and
the horror in death.

"Those who are tortured by aging and death": Those who are contacted, tortured,
combined, and possessed by aging; for those who are contacted, tortured,
combined, and possessed by death; for those who are born, followed by age,
conquered by disease, struck by death, those who have no shelter, those who have
no refuge.

"Dear Sir! Please tell me about the island": Please tell please explain, please
teach, please inform, please establish, please uncover, please analyze, please
clarify. "The island," shelter, refuge, place of refuge. "Dear sir," this is a

"Tell me about the island": "You," he called Blessed One. "Proclaim about the
island," please declare, please explain, ...(omitted)..., the island, the place
to go, the refuge, the shelter.

"According to this, there will be no more, subsequently": According to this,
suffering can be eliminated here, can be calmed down, can go to non-existence,
can stop; the suffering of rebirth does not occur; in the world of desire, or in
the physical realm, or in the non-material realm, or in the desire to be, or in
the physical being, or in the amorous being, or in the thought to be, or in the
non-imaginary, or in the four aggregates, or in the five aggregates, or in the
further interest, or in the rebirth, or in the incarnation, or in the existence,
or in the reincarnation, or in the rotation; not make it arise, not make it
born, it is here that it can be destroyed, can be calmed down, can go to
non-existence, can stop.
