### 2. The Cave

> 7 &middot; Stuck in the cave, covered by many (defilements),  
Sunk in foolishness,  
That kind of person is far away (from seclusion),  
Because desires in the world are not easy to give up.

"In the cave, covered by many": "Cave," like an animal is in a closed cave. The
cave is called the body, "body" or "cave" or ""accumulation" or "boat" or "cart"
or "flag" or "anthill" or "castle" or "nest" or "hut" or "tumor" or "urn" (or
"elephant"), these are bodies, which are synonyms for "stuck in the cave;" in
the cave he is stuck, entangled, suspended, attached, fixed, obstructed, such as
an item is stuck or entangled on a wall pile or wall hook, suspended, attached,
fixed, and obstructed. Similarly, in the cave he is stuck, entangled, suspended,
attached, fixed, and obstructed.

This is said by the Blessed One: [SN.23.2-3]  
"Rādha! All the desires, greed, joy, thirst, love, clinging, attachment,
holding, potential tendency of troubles, clinging there, and strong clinging
there, these are called 'beings;' Rādha! ...feeling.., perception, ...choice,
consciousness..., is called 'all beings.'" "Sentient being" is a synonym for
"adhesion" which means stuck in the cave. "Covered by many comprehensively,"
covered by many pollutions, covered by greed, ...hatred, delusion, anger,
resentment, hidden evil, domineering, jealousy, stinginess, fraud, cunning,
stubbornness, passion, sloth, extreme sloth, torpor, indulgence; covered by all
pollution, all evil deeds, all troubles, all scorching heat, all irritations,
covered by all bad practices, expanded coverage, upper coverage, obstruction
(blocking), enveloping, obstructing, closing, covering.

"The person who stays has sunk in ignorance": When people stay, the greedy
person stays because of greed; the angry person stays because of anger; the
foolish person stays because of ignorance; the tied (bonded) person stays
because of conceit; the clinging person stays because of seeing; the person who
comes to chaos stays because of being scattered; the person who does not come to
the conclusion stays because of doubt; the person who comes to the fortitude
stays because of the potential trend of troubles.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! There are forms that can be
recognized by the eye, that are desirable, lovely, desirable, attractive,
accommodating, and accompanied by greed. If the bhikkhus rejoice, welcome, and
cling to them, they should know, 'My skillfulness is declining, this is what the
Blessed One calls decline.' Bhikkhus! There is a sound that can be recognized by
the ear..., smell that can be recognized by the nose..., taste that can be
recognized by the tongue..., touch that can be known by the body..., (dhamma)
that can be known by the consciousness, which makes people desire; if the
bhikkhu rejoices, welcomes...." [SN.35.98]

This was said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! When consciousness abides with
form, it stays in form, stands on form, is supported by form, and with a
sprinkle of joy in it, it will grow and expand. Bhikkhus! When consciousness
abides with feeling..., ...perceiving...." [SN.22.53]

This was said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! If there is greed, joy, and thirst
in material food, so consciousness establishes and grows; where consciousness
establishes and grows, so there is the birth of name and form; where there is
the birth of name and form, so there are deeds; where there is the growth of the
deeds, so there is the birth of future rebirth; where there is the birth of
future rebirth, so there is future birth, aging, and death; where there are
future birth, aging, and death, Bhikkhus! I say: 'There is sadness, sorrow, and
despair.'" [SN.12.64]

"Bhikkhus! If in touch.... Bhikkhus! If desire for contact.... Bhikkhus! If
there is greed, joy, and thirst for contact as nutriment..., I say 'There is
sadness, sorrow, and despair.'" [SN.12.64]

"Sinking in foolishness," foolishness is called the five desires: the form which
can be recognized by the eye, desirable, lovely, agreeable, attractive-looking,
accompanied by desires, and greed for form; sound..., smell..., taste...,
touch.... Why is foolishness called the five desires? Most days, people become
foolish, ignorant, and confused in the five desires, becoming foolish, ignorant,
and confused, hindered, enveloped, obstructed, closed, covered, hidden; for that
reason, foolishness is called the five desires. "Sink in the foolishness,"
sinking, entering, sneaking into, and falling into the foolishness.

"For someone like that, he is really far away": "Far away," there are three
types of distance: body distance, heart distance, and clinging distance. What is
body distance? Here, bhikkhus live close and alone: in the woods, under the
trees, in mountains, caves, cemeteries, forests, open fields, straw piles,
living far away with the body [Ni.14, 150], he walks alone, stands alone, sits
alone, lies alone, enters the village alone for alms, returning alone, sitting
alone in a quiet place, alone performing prayers, walking, staying, acting,
going on, guarding, surviving, and living alone, is to be away with the body.

What is the mind (heart) away? The mind of the person who enters the first jhāna
has moved away from the covers, the mind of the person who has entered the
second jhāna has been separated from the search and service, the heart of the
person who has entered the third jhāna has been separated from happiness, the
heart of the person who has entered the fourth jhāna has been separated from
happiness and suffering, the mind of the person who has entered the boundless
void has already thought about opposing things and is away from all kinds of
desires, the heart of the person who has entered the boundlessness of
consciousness has wanted to be far away from the boundless void, the mind of the
person who has entered nothingness has thought to stay away from the
boundlessness of consciousness, and the mind of the person who has no thoughts
has wanted to stay away from nothingness. The mind of the Sotāpanna person has
changed from seeing, suspicious, forbidden, seeing the potential trend of
defilement, the potential trend of doubt defilement, and the same. The pollution
of existence is far away. The heart of the one who has come has changed from the
rough desire and greed knot, the disgust knot, the latent tendency of the rough
desire, greed and trouble, the potential trend of disgust and trouble, and the
pollution of the same existence. The remaining knots of desire and greed,
disgust, from the remaining potential trends of desire, greed, disgust, and the
pollution that exist with them, the Arahant's heart has changed from formless
greed, conceit, abandonment, ignorance, and conceit trouble potential, the
tendency, the latent tendency of greed and defilements, the latent tendency of
ignorance defilements, and the pollution that coexists with and the distance
from the outside and everything. This is the distance from the mind.

What is keeping (clinging) away? Dependence is called pollution and various
aggregates and various works; dependence distance is called non-living, Nibbāna,
that is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of all dependence, the
extinction of craving, greed, extinguishment, and Nibbāna. This is to stay away.
The distance of the body belongs to the continuous separation of the body and
the willingness to leave the desire; the distance of the mind belongs to the
purity of the heart and the highest purity; the separation of the clinging
belongs to the unattached person, who comes to the liberation.

"He is indeed far away," where he is stuck in the cave, so covered by so many,
so sunken in foolishness, he is far away from the body; also far away from the
heart; also far away from dependence, very far away, not near; at the place
being pulled away. "Like that kind of person," like that, belong to that
dwelling, that kind, similar to that, the one who has sunk in foolishness.

"Because it is not easy to give up the desires in the world": "Desire," there
are two kinds of desires: the desire of things and the desire of pollution. What
are the desires of things? ...(omitted, see previous sections).

What is the desire for pollution? ...(omitted, see previous sections).

"Seeing those roots of desire,  
Wanting to be produced by thought (intention),  
I will not think of them,  
So desire will not exist."  
[Jat.8.421]

These are called the desire for pollution. "In the world": ...(omitted, see
previous sections). "Because it is really not easy to give up the world of
desire": Because in the world of desire it is hard to give up, hard to
disconnect, hard to break (conquer), hard to untie, hard to unravel, hard to
release, difficult to escape, difficult to overcome, difficult to take off, and
difficult to pass.

> 8 &middot; Being bound by the pleasure of having what they want,  
They are hard to get rid of because there is no freedom from other people,  
Looking forward to later or even back to the past,  
They look forward to these desires or those of the past.

"Being bound by the pleasure of having because of wanting": Want is called
craving, that is greed..., unwholesome roots. "With the cause of wanting," with
wanting as the cause, wanting as the reason, wanting as the condition, wanting
as the root cause.

"Being bound by happiness," One kind of happiness: happiness; two kinds of
happiness: happiness and satisfying things; three kinds of happiness: youth,
freedom from disease, and life; four kinds of happiness: gain, fame,
appreciation, and peace; five kinds of happiness: desirable form, desirable
sound, desirable smell, desirable taste, desirable touch; six kinds: of the
eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind. To be bound by the pleasure of happiness:
bound by the joy of pleasure, bound by the satisfaction, bound by the youth,
bound by the freedom from disease, bound by the life, bound by the profit, bound
by the reputation, to be bound to admiration, to be bound to comfort; to be tied
to the desired form, to sound, smell, taste, touch; to the eye, ear, nose,
tongue, and body; bound, tied, attached, fixed, obstructed.

"They are hard to get rid of because they are not freed by others": They are
hard to get rid of things with pleasure, or all beings are difficult to relieve.
How is it difficult for them to relieve pleasure in things? Pleasure is hard to
get rid of, satisfying things are hard to get rid of, youth is hard to get rid
of, ...; difficult to break away, difficult to dissolve, difficult to release,
difficult to unlock, difficult to overcome, difficult to pass.

How is it that beings are difficult to relieve here? It is difficult for
sentient beings to get rid of pleasure, for sentient beings to be released from
satisfying things, for sentient beings to be released from youth, ...; it's hard
to pull out, it's hard to pull out completely, it's hard to rise, it's hard to
rise completely, difficult to unlock, difficult to release..., difficult to
pass.

"Because they are not free by other people," those who fell into the mud
themselves cannot pull out the others who fell into the mud. This was said by
the Blessed One: "Cunda! 'I am the one who is in the quagmire and will pull out
the others in the quagmire.' This is impossible. Cunda! 'Oneself is an
unregulated, untrained, and non-Nibbāna one, and will make others tune, train,
and attain Nibbāna.' This is impossible." [MN.8]

Or, you don't have any other liberators; those who can be liberated, use their
own power, with their own strength, with their own vitality, with their own
efforts, with their own forces, with their own strength, with their own human
power, with their own human vitality, with their own human efforts, with their
own correct way, following the way, the non-opposite way, according to the right
way, and the way according to the Dhamma, they can be liberated when they
practice.

This is also said by the Blessed One: [Ni.22]  
"I will not be able liberate, Dhotaka, anyone who doubts in the world,  
When you know the best Dhamma, then you will get through this torrent."

This is also said by the Blessed One: [Dph.12, 165]  
"He has done evil, he is polluted,  
He who does do not do evil, he comes pure,  
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure."

This was also said by the Blessed One: "Similarly, Brāhmaṇa, Nibbāna stays and
abides, the path which leads to Nibbāna stays and abides, and my persuasion
(teaching) stays and abides. However, when my disciples are taught and
admonished in this way, some of them reach the ultimate end of Nibbāna, and some
do not reach. Brāhmaṇa, What can I do here? Brāhmaṇa, The Tathāgata is the
guide. [MN.107] The Buddha only told (directed) the way, and when they practice
it by themselves, they could be free."

"Looking forward to later, or even to the past": Later is called the future, and
the past is called the past. In addition, after clinging to the past, the future
and the present are behind; after clinging to the future, the past and the
present are in front. How is it to look forward to the past? "I had such a form
in the past," to find joy there [MN.132]; "I had such feelings in the past..., I
had such thoughts in the past..., I had this kind of behavior in the past..., I
had this kind of knowledge in the past." Looking for joy there, this is to look
forward to the past.

Or, "My eyes were like that, and my forms were like that." There, consciousness
is bound by desire and greed; when consciousness is bound by desire and greed,
it rejoices; when it is rejoiced, this is also an expectation of the past. "My
ears were like that, and my voice was like that." ..., "my nose..., smell...,
..., ...tongue, ...taste..., ...body, ...touch"..., mind..., dhammas...." There,
consciousness is bound by desire and greed; when consciousness is bound by
desire and greed, it rejoices; when it rejoiced [MN.133], this is also an
expectation from the past.

Or, whoever laughed, talked, and played with women before, he enjoys it, desires
it, and comes to happiness because of it [AN.7.50], which is also looking
forward to the past.

How is it to look forward to later? "I will look like this in the future."
Looking for joy there, "I will have this feeling in the future. ...I will think
so in the future. ...I will do this in the future. ...I will have this knowledge
in the future." Looking for joy there, this is to look forward to later.

Or, "My eyes will be like that in the future, and my forms will be like that."
Have hope of the unobtained heart, and rejoice in the hope of the heart; when
you rejoice in it, this is the expectation for later. "My ears...." Hope of the
unobtained heart ..., this is also the expectation for later.

Or, "I will become (into) the heaven, or one of the heavens, with this virtue,
prohibition, asceticism, and Brahma." Hope of the unobtained heart....

"Waiting for these desires, or looking to the past": "In these desires," in the
present five desires, wanting, receiving, aspiring, longing, and praying. Or to
the past, looking eagerly, eagerly looking forward to, begging for, and begging
on the past five desires.

> 9 &middot; Those who are greedy and enthusiastic in desire are ignorant,  
And those who are stingy are fixed on the wrong,  
When suffering results, they weep:  
Where will we be after we die from here?

"Those who are greedy and enthusiastic in desire are ignorant": "Desire," There
are two kinds of desires.... Craving is called craving, which is greed....
Greed, craving, and being tied to the desire of things with the desire of the
pollution knot, being fascinated, tainted, attached, fixed, obstructed.

"Enthusiasts," whoever seeks, searches, and asks all over the desires, this
character, the more, the serious, the target, the hardworking, the inclined, and
the overcomer, those who increase, they are passionate ones. Anyone who seeks,
searches, and asks in all forms..., ..sounds..., smells, tastes, touches....
Those who focus on that, those who take that as the object, those who work hard,
those who incline toward them, those who overcome them, those who increase them,
they are also passionate ones. Anyone who gets in the forms because of
thirst..., in the sound..., smell, taste, touch, ...they are also enthusiasts in
desire. Whoever is used in the forms.... For example, critics are keen to
criticize, workers are keen to do work, those who walk in the village are keen
on walking in the village, and meditators are keen on meditation. In the same
way, whoever seeks..., they are passionate ones. Where in all forms because of
thirst, seeking, searching, begging all over..., ...in sound..., smell, taste,
touch.... Anyone who gets in the forms.... Whosoever is used in the forms...,
they are also enthusiasts in desire.

"Ignorance," most days, people become foolish...(omitted). Those who are greedy
and passionate about desires are ignorant.

"The stingy are fixed on the wrong": "The stingy," "they go down" are the
stingy; "the miserly" is also called the stingy; "not to care about the words
and ways of the Buddha's disciples and teachings" is a stingy one. How is "they
go down" as a stingy one? They go to hell; they go to the animal world; they go
to the evil world, this is "they go down." How is a "miserly person" also called
a stingy person? There are five kinds of stingy: stingy in dwelling, in home, of
gain, of praise, of Dhamma, stingy appearance, stingy state, greed, miserly,
petty, and heart-tight state are called stingy. In addition, miserliness is also
stingy; world stinginess is also stingy; stinginess in views is also stingy.
With this stinginess and intolerance, people become illiberal, so they are
called stingy. How is it "not to care about the words, language, and teachings
of Buddha disciples" as stingy? The words, ways of speaking, teaching, and
admonitions of Buddha's disciples, they don't care, don't want to listen, don't
listen to them, don't need to know the words, don't want to hear, don't need to
know them.

"They are fixed on the wrong," fixed in the wrong body kamma, fixed in the wrong
language kamma, fixed in the wrong mental kamma, fixed in the wrong killing,
fixed in taking without giving, fixed in unrighteous lewdness, fixed in
unrighteous deceit, in unrighteous divisive language..., vulgar language...,
obscene language, greed, malice, view, deeds, five desires, five covers, deeply
fixed, stuck, stopped, entered, stained, turned towards, attached, obstructed,
blocked.

"When there is suffering, they weep." "When there is suffering," it means that
suffering has been reached, the demon has been reached, death has been reached,
and death is close. "They are weeping," they grumble, weep, are sad, tired,
grieve, pound their breasts and cry, and come to confusion.

"Where will we exist after we die from here": "Where will we exist after we die
from here? Will we be hell-fallen, beast-fallen, ghost-fallen, will we be
people, will we become gods, formed ones, formless ones, become thinkers,
non-thinkers, non-thinking ones." "Do we exist in the future? Do we not exist in
the future life? What will we be in the future life? What will our future life
be like? What will we be in the future life, and what will (later) become?"
Leap-into doubters, jump-into skeptics, arise doubts, they grumble, weep....

> 10 &middot; So here, people should learn,  
And they should know that anything "wrong" in the world,  
For that reason one should not do wrong,  
Because wise people say that this life is short.

"Therefore people should learn here": "Therefore," With that reason, that cause,
that condition cause, when you see this fault in desire. "Should learn," there
are three kinds of learning: increasing precept learning, increasing mind
learning, increasing wisdom learning.

What is to add to precepts? Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who lives and is
protected by the self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient righteousness
and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns after
accepting from a teacher. Small precepts aggregate and large precept aggregates
are the foundation of abstinence, the (self) inhibition of behavior, the
entrance of self-control, the uppermost of good dhamma, etc., this is to
increase precept learning.

What is to increase mind? Here, the bhikkhu lives in the first jhāna of
reasoning and thinking after he is absent from desires and unwholesome Dhamma,
and after detachment produces joy and happiness; he calms down reasoning and
thinking, with confidence, and one mind, and after entering, he lives in no
reasoning, the second jhāna of joy and happiness is born without waiting;
concentration, which fades with joy and dwells in peace, has mindfulness and
right knowledge, and feels happiness in the body, after entering, dwelling in,
this holy disciple proclaims: "He is calm and possessed" in the third jhāna of
"mindfulness and abiding in the bliss;" with the renunciation of pleasure and
the renunciation of suffering, and the extinction of joy and sorrow in the past,
after entering, dwells in where there is no suffering or unhappiness in the
fourth jhāna, this is to increase the mind.

What is to increase wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a wise person, possessing the
wisdom that leads to the arising and passing away; the holy, insight, and the
complete extinction of suffering is (the wisdom), he truthfully knows "This is
suffering." I know "This is the collection of suffering." I know "This is
suffering." I know "This is the path to suffering." To know the truth: "These
are troubles." To know the truth: "This is a collection of troubles." To know
the truth: "This is the elimination of suffering." To know the truth: "This is
the path leading to suffering." This is to increase wisdom.

These three studies should be learned when heading towards (noting); learning
when knowing; learning when seeing; learning when introspecting; learning when
establishing (decision) when the heart is established; learning when solving
with faith; you should learn when you are vigorous; you should learn when
mindfulness arises; you should learn when the mind has concentration; you should
learn when you know with wisdom; you should learn when you know what should be
known; when knowledge should be known; we should learn when we should be
renounced; we should learn when we should be practiced; we should learn when we
should be testified, we should practice, we should practice well, and we should
learn when we hold and go on.

"Here" belongs to this view, belongs to this like, belongs to this inclination,
in this attachment, in this dhamma, in this teaching, in this holy way, in the
teachings of this master, in this individual, in this human world; that is
called "here." "People," beings, human beings....

"You should know everything that is 'incorrect' in the world": "Anything," all
completely, completely in every aspect, with no remaining ground, and the whole
ground. This is the ubiquitous language, which is "anything." "You should know
the 'incorrect,'" you should know that the improper body kamma is "incorrect,"
you should know that the improper language kamma is "incorrect," you should know
that the improper mental kamma is "incorrect," you should know the improper
killing is "incorrect," ..., unjustly not given and taken..., evil..., lie,
divisive words, vulgar language, obscene language, greed, malice, wrong views,
wrong wrong behaviors, five desires, five wrong covers...: It should be known,
it should be distinguished, and it should be understood. "In the world," in the
world of the suffering world....

"One should not do wrong, for that reason": With the cause of wrong body kamma
one should not do wrong; with the cause of wrong language kamma...; with the
cause of wrong thinking, wrong hope, wrong desire..., one should not do wrong:
should not be practiced, should not be fully practiced, should not be held after
going on.

"Because the wise people say that this life is little (less, short)": "Life" is
the survival of life; the going-on of life, survival, and action; the guardian
(keeper) of life and the root of life. In addition, life is short due to two
factors: the limited life based on survival, or limited life based on natural
finite life. How is the limited life of existence less? Living in the past heart
moment, (but) not living now, not living in the future; living in the future
heart moment, (but) not living now and not living in the past; living in the
present heart moment now, (but) not living in the past, not living in the
future.

"Life and individual, all (only) happiness and suffering,  
Taken with a single heart: it can turn around in an instant.  
Where the heavens exist, eighty-four thousand tribulations,  
But neither of them, combined to live by two hearts.  
Anyone who dies or survives here, the aggregates are destroyed,  
have gone, everything is, and the same cannot be restored.  
Those who are immediately destroyed, and those who are destroyed in the future,  
(And) those who are destroyed in the middle are not unequal in characteristics.  
He could not help but was born, he lives now,  
With the heart being destroyed, the world becomes dead, and it is the peace of the highest interest.  
They happen as downward (flowing) and are intended to change,  
They turn (such as) the uncut water flow, with six points as an edge.  
The destroyed ones come without storage, and there will be no accumulation in the future,  
And wherever arises, they survive, like mustard seeds at the tip of the cone (moment).  
To the arising dhammas, destruction is placed in front of them,  
The broken dhammas remain, and they do not mix with the previous ones.  
They come invisible, they see and leave from destruction,  
Like lightning in the sky, they arise and dissipate."

How is the limited life of nature less? Life is the dependent of the breath;
life is the dependent of the income; life is the dependent of the intake and
exit; life is the dependent of the (four) species; life is the dependent of
lumps of food; life is the dependent of the warmth; life is the dependent of the
consciousness: These are fundamentally weak; the causes of these are also weak;
those who rely on them are also weak; those who use them as power are also weak;
the common foundation of these is also weak; these connections are also weak;
these co-borns are also weak; everything connected with them is also weak; these
are habitually weak to each other; these are not standing on each other; these
are mutually destructive; there is no mutual shelter, and these don't make each
other stand; those who produce are not discovered.

"No one disappears because of anyone else, and these are indeed all destroyed,
these are produced from before, and those who produced them have died before,
the former and the latter have never seen each other."

In addition, comparing the lives of the four deva kings, life is less for
humans, life is insignificant, life is only a few, life is instant, life is
rapid, life is short, life is not a long time, the fate is to live soon, the
thirty-three heavenly gods...(omitted), Tusita gods..., fashioned gods...,
transformed into the happy heaven gods..., he transformed into the heavenly
gods..., compared to the life of the Brahma gods, the life of people is small,
life is insignificant, life is only a few, life is instant, life is fast, life
is short, life is not long, and life is short-lived.

This was said by the Blessed One:  
"Bhikkhus! The life span of human beings is short, and they must come to the
next life. A wise man should be awakened, be kind, and practice brahma. All
living are dead, bhikkhus! Those living elders have (only) a hundred years or
more."

"The life span of a person is short,  
And good people should disregard (have contempt for) it,  
They should live as if their head is burning,  
(Because) there is no death that does not come."  
[SN.4.10]

"Day and night pass,  
Life is destroyed,  
Inevitably the life span of a person who will die is exhausted,  
Like water in a small river."  
[SN.4.10]

"Because the wise people say that this life is short": The wise one is the sage,
and the wisdom is called wisdom, that is understanding, simple selection,
investigation, method selection, identification, discrimination, close
observation, erudition, proficiency, cleverness, contemplation, deep
contemplation, examination, comprehensive, Righteous Knowledge, Stabbing Rod (of
wisdom), Wisdom Root, Wisdom Sword, Wisdom Hall, Wisdom Protection, Wisdom
Brightness, Wisdom Light, No Deception, Choosing Dhamma, Right View; regard the
state of wisdom as the wise. In addition, the sage of accumulation, the sage of
the realm, the sage of the place, the sage of dependent origin, the sage of
mindfulness, the sage of diligence, the sage of the gods, the sage of the root,
the sage of strength, the sage of enlightenment, the sage of the Path, the sage
of the Fruit, the sage of Nibbāna, those sages say: "For people, life is small,
life is insignificant, life is only a few, life is instant, life is rapid, life
is short, life is not long-term, life is short-lived." They say so, tell so,
talk so, explain so, say so.

> 11 &middot; I see the world trembling:  
This generation comes to craving love among all beings,  
The inferior people grumble before the mouth of death:  
Those who have not separated the thirst in all kinds of existence.

"I see the world trembling": "I saw," I saw with the naked eye, I saw with the
eye of the heavens, I saw with my eye, I saw with the eyes of the Buddha, I saw
with all eyes, I see, I watch, I contemplate, I observe. "In the world": In the
world of suffering....

"Trembling (throbbing)," throbbing with the throbbing of desire; ...of seeing,
...of pollution, effort, fruit, evil deeds, greed, anger, ignorance, conceit,
clinging to seeing, disorganization (scatteredness), doubtful failure, worrying
potential trends; profit, no profit, reputation, no reputation, praise, rebuke,
joy, suffering, life, old age, sickness, death, sadness and despair; suffering
of falling into hell, into the beast world, into the hungry ghost world, human
world; throbbing by suffering of entering the womb, rooted in the womb,
suffering of birth, of living, of others' manipulation, of their own actions,
others' actions; throbbing with suffering, with the sufferings of doing, the
pain of change; throbbing with the suffering of eye disease, ear..., nose,
tongue, body, head... (omitted, see previous sections for list of all
afflictions); throbbing with the suffering of the dead mother... (omitted, see
previous sections)...; throbbing, completely throbbing, expanding throbbing,
trembling, tremoring with the pain of seeing, I saw, I watched, I contemplated,
I observed.

"This generation comes to thirst among all beings": "Generation (people)" is
synonymous with all beings. "Thirst" is the craving for form, ...sound, smell,
taste, touch, dhammas. "Come to thirst," comes to thirst; followed by thirst;
approached by thirst; overwhelmed by thirst, conquered, and the heart is
overtaken. "In all beings" is desire, form, and formlessness.

"Inferior people complain before death": "Inferior people," "having inferior
body kamma" as inferior people; "having inferior language kamma" as inferior
people; "having inferior mental kamma" as inferior people; "inferior in
killing"..., giving and taking... (omitted, see previous sections)..., "have the

> 12 &middot; Look! The trembling person regards things as their own,  
Like a fish in a little depleted water,  
After seeing this, one should do nothing (not do this thing),  
Not following there (in forming attachments to existence).

"Look! People who tremble take things as their own": "Clinging to their own,"
there are two types of self-clinging: of thirsty self and of seeing. What is the
thirsty self? All are called boundaries, realms, scopes, borders, ...(omitted,

seeing, after seeing, after weighing, after judging, after separating, after
clarifying. "Should do no-self," there are two kinds of self-holdings: .... If
you break away from the self-holding of the one who is thirsty; if you cut off

ears..., nose, tongue, body, mind; ...all forms..., sounds, smells, tastes,

Not carrying out anything for which he would reprimand (rebuke) himself,  
The wise are not contaminated by what they see and hear.

collection is the second side; the past is one side, the future is the second
side; pleasure is one side, suffering is the second side; formlessness called
one side, form is the second side; the six inside is one side, and the six
outside is the second side; there is body as one side, and the body collection
is the second side. "Desire," .... "After tempering the desire on both sides":

cut off, give up, drive away, end, and make it go to non-existence. This was
said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! All the desires and greed of contact must be
cut off. In this way, the contact will be cut off, and the roots will be cut
off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent and non-living
for the future." [SN.22.25] This is renunciation.

"Observing after touch," with these three types of knowledge and after touch.
"There is no greed," greed is called craving.... Anyone who is cut off, severed,
calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, and burned by the fire of wisdom, he is
called a craving-free person. He is not craving in appearance; in sound, smell,
taste, touch; at home...(omitted)..., in the present; in what you see, hear,
feel, the dhammas that can be known are those that are not craving, not bound,
