### 11. Quarrels and Arguments

97. From where are there many quarrels and arguments, weeping, sadness, and
    stinginess?
Conceit, arrogance, and divisiveness, where are they many? Come! Please tell me
    about that.

"Where are there many quarrels and arguments": "Quarrels" are quarrels based on
one behavior, and "arguments" are the same. Anyone who argues, it is a quarrel;
whoever argues, it is an argument. Or, in another way, arguing is called the
first part of the quarrel. King arguing with king, khattiya arguing with
khattiya, Brahman arguing with Brahman, homeowner arguing with homeowner, mother
arguing with son, son arguing with mother, father arguing with son, son arguing
with father, brother arguing with brother, brothers argue with sisters, sisters
argue with brothers, friends argue with friends [MN.13]. What is a quarrel?
Those who are keen on clubs at home quarrel with their bodies and words, and
those who violate precepts quarrel with their bodies and words.

"Where are there many quarrels and arguing": "Where are there many quarrels and
quarrels? Where are they born? Where are they arising? Where are they generated?
What are their causes? What is the collection? What is its birth? What is its
root?" "He inquired about the root of quarrel and argument; he inquired about
the reason; he inquired about the cause; he inquired about the arising; he
inquired about the generation; he inquired and waited; he inquired about food;
he inquired about the fate; he inquired about the collection, he forcefully
inquired, begged, requested, and asked for it to be made clear."

"Weeping, sorrow and stinginess": "Weeping, ...(omitted, see previous

"From where are there many of these? Come! Please tell me about that": ""Where
do these eight kinds of pollution, "quarrel, argument, weeping, sadness,
stinginess, conceit, arrogance, and divisive speech", come from a lot? Where are
they born? Where do they arise? ...(omitted). What is its root?" "He asked about
the roots of these eight kinds of pollution; he asks the reason;
...(omitted).... "Where do those come from? Come! Please tell that": "Come!
Please tell, please explain, please teach, please inform, please build, please
uncover, please analyze, please clarify."

98. From what is lovely, there are many quarrels and arguments, weeping,
    sadness, and stinginess,
Conceit, arrogance, together with divisive speech, quarrels and arguments are
    connected to stinginess, and there is divisive speech when disputes arise.

"From what is lovely there are a lot of quarrels, weeping, sadness and
stinginess": "Lovely", there are two kinds of lovely: ...(omitted, see previous
sections).

They quarrel when lovely things are suspected of being robbed, they also quarrel
when they are robbed, and they also quarrel when they have been robbed;
...(omitted, see previous sections).

"Conceit, arrogance, and divisive words": "Depending on lovely things makes them
conceited; depending on cute things makes them arrogant. How does depending on
lovely things make them conceited? "We are the recipients of desirable forms,
sounds, smells, tastes, and touches." This is the production of conceit with
lovely things. How does reliance on lovely things produce arrogance? "We are the
recipients of the desired forms, ..., and these other people are not the
recipients of the desired forms, ...." This is reliance on lovely things making
them arrogant. "Divisive speech", ...(omitted, see previous sections).

"Quarrels and arguments are connected to stinginess": ""Quarrel, arguing,
weeping, sorrow, conceit, arrogance, and divisive speech" These seven pollutions
are connected, strongly connected, and connected completely."

"And when a dispute arises, there are divisive words": "When a dispute arises,
when it is born, when it appears, it produces a divide: He hears from here and
speaks there in order to separate these people, ...(omitted, see previous
sections)."

99. Where is the cause of the loveliness in the world, where the greedy moving
    around in the world?
Where is the cause for wish and fulfillment, anyone who has a next life?

"Where does the loveliness in the world come from?": "Where does the loveliness
come from?  Where is it born? ...(omitted). What is its root?" He asked about
the loveliness... (omitted)."

"Everyone who is greedy walks around in the world": "The "what..." are
khattiya, brāhmaṇa, vessa, sudda, lay family, bhikkhu, heaven, and person.
"Greed", the state of all greed, desire, and thirst, the state of being greedy,
tainted, and stained, and unwholesome. "Walk", walk, live, act, turn, guard, and
survive. "In the world": In the world of suffering, the world of mankind, the
world of heaven, the world of aggregates, the world of realms, the world of
places."

"Where is the cause of desire and fulfillment?": "Where is the cause of desire
and fulfillment? Where do they arise? ...(omitted). What is its root?" He asked
about the root of desire and fulfillment... (omitted)." "Anyone who has a next
life": "Anyone who has a foundation, a shelter, a refuge, a place of return,
completion and a next life."

100. The loveliness in the world has desire as its cause, everyone who is greedy
     walks around in the world,
Wish and fulfillment are the cause from here, everyone who has an afterlife.

"The lovely desire in the world is its cause": "Desire", all the desires of the
desires, the greed of the desires, the joy of the desires, the thirst of the
desires, the love of the desires, the fascination of the desires, the desires of
anxiety, obsession with desire, torrent of desire, yoke (binding) of desire,
clinging to desire, cover of desire. In addition, there are five kinds of
desires: the desire to seek, the desire to obtain, the desire to receive, the
desire to store, and the desire to spend. What is the desire to seek (ask)?
Here, a certain type of person is precisely the taker, the hoper, and the one
who has the desire to be born. He seeks all the forms..., all the sounds..., all
the smells..., all the tastes..., all the touches. This is the desire of all
seeking. What is the desire to acquire? Here, a certain type of person is just
the taker, the hoper, and the one who desires to be born. He acquires all
forms...(omitted). This is the desire to acquire. What is the desire to use?
Here, a certain type of person is the taker, the hoper, and the aspirant. He
receives the forms.... This is the desire to use. What is the intention of
storage? Here, a certain type of person is precisely the one who takes, the one
who hopes, the one who desires to be born, he is the (one who wants)
accumulation of property (, thinking): "There will be disasters." This is the
desire to store. What is the intention to spend? Here, a certain type of person
is the taker, the hoper, and the survivor. He spends his money on elephant
soldiers, horse soldiers, chariot soldiers, archers, and infantry (, thinking):
"These will guard, protect, and serve me." This is the desire to spend.
"Lovely", there are two kinds of lovely: living beings or deeds... (omitted).
"The lovely desire in the world is its cause": "The lovely desire is its cause;
the desire is its collection; the desire is its birth; the desire is its root."

"Everyone who is greedy walks around in the world": "The "what..." are
khattiya, Brahman, ...(omitted). "Greed", the state of all greed, ...(omitted).
"Walk", walk, live, .... "In the world": In the world of suffering...."

"Wish and fulfillment is the cause here": Wish is called craving, which is
greed, .... roots. "Fulfillment", here, when a certain type of person seeks
various forms, he gets the form and becomes the one who is fulfilled with the
form; ...the sounds..., the smells..., the tastes..., the touches, (... the
dhammas)..., ...home..., group..., housing, profit, reputation, praise, clothes,
food, housing, patients' needs and medical necessities, Sutta, Dhamma,
Abhidhamma, forest dwelling, regular begging, dung sweeping clothing, only three
robes, second begging, not eating after eating, often sitting (not lying), first
jhāna, second jhāna, third jhāna, fourth jhāna, wait until the void is
boundless, wait until the boundless knowledge, wait until there is nowhere, when
he asks for nothing and wants to wait everywhere, obtain the non-ideal and
non-ideal and wait until, become the one who completes the non-ideal and
non-ideal and waiting (??).

"Plowing the fields with wishes, sowing seeds with wishes,
Embarking on trade with a wish, the transporter of goods (over) the sea,
Whoever stands by wishes, (thinking) 'may my wish succeed'." [Thag.530]

The success of a wish is called completion (fulfillment). "Wish and fulfillment
is its cause from here": "Wish and fulfillment is its cause from here; desire is
its collection; desire is its life; desire is its root."

"Anyone who has an afterlife (a next life)": ...(omitted, see previous).

101. So where is the cause of the desire in the world, and (from) where are
     there many judgements?
(And) anger, false words and doubts, as well as all the (other) dhamma spoken by
    Samaṇa?

"Then where does the desire in the world come from?": "Where does the desire
come from? Where does it arise? ...(omitted)" He asks about the root of
desire...."

"And where are there many judgments": ""Where do judgments come from? Where are
they born? ...." He asked about the root of judgment...."

"Anger, false words and doubts": "'Anger' is anger, ...(omitted, see previous
sections). False words are called lies, Doubt is called suspicions."

"And all the dhammas spoken of by Samaṇa": ""And all the (dhammas)", all those
who are spoken in anger and falsehood will walk with doubts, co-exist,
intermingle, correspond, and have the same place of dependence, the same object,
these are called 'and all dhammas'. Or, all those other kinds of pollution that
are polluted by other participation, these are also called 'and all dhammas'.
"Spoken of by the Samaṇa", the Samaṇa who has quelled evil, Brahmins who have
rejected evil, Bhikkhus who have destroyed the roots of pollution, those who
have freed all evil and unwholesome roots, said, explained, taught, told,
established, uncovered, analyzed, and explained."

102. In the world, what they say is "desirable" or "undesirable", they rely on
     that to generate desire,
After seeing non-existence and existence of physical form, people make (come to)
    judgements in the world.

"In the world where they say "desirable, undesirable"": ""Desirable", pleasant
and desirable affairs. "Undesirable", suffering and undesirable affairs." In the
world, everything they say", everything they say, everything they tell, ...."

"Rely on that to generate desire": "Rely on the desirable and undesirable; rely
on the joy and suffering; rely on the joy and sorrow; rely on the desirable and
undesirable; rely on the love, after disgust, the desire arises, occurs, is
arisen, is produced, and is born."

"After seeing non-existence and existence in form": "in form", the four great
elements and form created of the four great elements. What is the existence of
form? The existence, arising, production, birth, and appearance of all forms are
the existence of form. What is the non-existence of form? The extinction,
dissipation, destruction, incontinence, impermanence, and disappearance of all
forms are the non-existence of form. "After seeing non-existence and existence
in form": "After seeing, after measuring, after judging, after separating, and
clarifying the existence and non-existence in form."

"In the world, people make judgments": ""Judgment", there are two kinds of
judgments: the judgment of craving and the judgment of seeing. What is the
judgment of craving? Here, the property that a certain kind of person has not
arisen does not arise, and the property that has already arisen ends, he thought
this way: "Why doesn't my unborn (non-arisen) property arise, and the property
that has arisen has gone to the end?" He thought again: "For the dedication of
wine, fruit wine, wine for the practitioner (??), my unborn property does not
arise, and the property that has arisen is exhausted; for the practitioner who
is committed to the street that is not suitable for time, my unborn property
does not arise, and the wealth that has arisen has gone everywhere; for the
practitioners who linger on the exhibition,..., for the practitioners who are
committed to gambling and relaxation, ..., for the practitioners who are
committed to evil friends..., for the practitioner who is committed to laziness
....[DN.31, paragraph 247]" After doing this wisely, he does not get close to
the failures of the six properties; to get close to the gains of the six
properties, this is a judgment of eagerness.

Or, he plows the field, or buys and sells, or grazes cattle, or kings (??), or
uses other skills to practice (act??), which is also a judgment of thirst. What
is the judgment of seeing? Here, when the eyes have arisen, he realizes (knows):
"My true self has arisen. When his eyes disappeared, he realized: "My true self
has disappeared; my true self has gone." This is a judgment of seeing. When the
ears..., nose..., tongue..., body..., color..., sound..., taste..., smell....
This is also the judgment of seeing; he causes it to arise, to produce, to be
born. "Humans" are all beings, .... "In the world": ...."

103. Anger, false words, and doubt, (arise) when there are two kinds of dhammas,
The doubter should learn it on the path of wisdom; after knowing it, the dhammas
    are explained by Samaṇa.

"Anger, false words and doubts": ""Anger" ..., false words are called lies,
doubts are called suspicions. Anger arises after the desired affairs; anger also
arises after reliance on undesirable things. Lies arise after reliance on
undesirable affairs; ...(omitted). Doubts...(omitted).

How is anger aroused after relying on undesirable affairs? After reliance on
undesirable matters, anger naturally arises: "He has been against me.
...(omitted, see previous sections)."

How is anger aroused after relying on a desirable task? Anger is raised when
suspicious of being robbed, ....

How do you get false speech after relying on undesirable affairs? Here, a
certain type of person is bound by the shackles of handcuffs, and deliberately
said vain (words) for the sake of that detachment..., or tied by ropes..., or
tied by shackles..., or tied by vines..., or tied by shackles of the
Geman(??)..., or tied by the shackles thrown in (the Ganges??)..., or tied by
the shackles of the fence..., or tied by the shackles of the villages, towns,
cities and countries..., or tied by the shackles of the locality, in order to
depart from these shackles, he is deliberately saying falsehoods.

How do you get false speech after relying on something you want? Here, a certain
kind of people deliberately speak vainly for the reason of the desirable form,
for the desirable smell, ...(omitted)..., the patient's needs and medical
necessities, he speaks deliberately vain (words).

How can doubt arise after reliance on undesirable affairs? "Will I get rid of
eye disease? Will I not get rid of eye diseases? Will I get rid of ear problems?
...(omitted)."

How can doubt arise after relying on desired affairs? "Will I get the form that
I want? Will I not get the desired form? ....""

"When there are two kinds, there are these dhammas": "When there are agreeable
and undesirable; when there is happiness and suffering; when there is joy and
sorrow; when there is a want and non-want; when there is love and hatred, when
it is known, and when (both) are found there."

"The doubter should learn on the way of wisdom": Wisdom is the way of wisdom;
the object of wisdom is also the way of wisdom; the Dhamma that arises with
wisdom is also the way of wisdom, as the holy way is the holy way; the way of
heaven is the way of heaven; the way of Brahman is the Brahmin way, wisdom is
the path of wisdom; the object of wisdom is also the path of wisdom; the Dhamma
that arises with wisdom is also the path of wisdom.

"Learning", there are three kinds of learning: ...(omitted, see previous
sections).

"The doubter should learn on the way of wisdom": "The doubter, the person who
has doubts, confusion, and hesitations, in order to reach wisdom, to (arrive
at??) wisdom, and to testify (to) wisdom, should learn more ...(omitted, see
previous sections).

"After knowing, the dhamma is explained by Samaṇa": ""After knowing", after
knowing, ..., being said, explained, ...: "All actions are impermanent" after
knowing, ...; "All actions are suffering"...; "All Dhamma is selfless"...;
"There is action based on ignorance"...; "Life is the predestined condition, and
there is old age and death"...; "With ignorance and death, there is action and
death"...; "By birth and death, there is old age and death"...; "This is
suffering"...; "This is the path leading to misery"...; "These are troubles"...;
"This is the path leading to troubles"...; "These dhammas should be proven"...;
"These dhammas should be known"...; "These Dhamma should be cut off"...; "These
Dhamma should be practiced"...; "These Dhamma should be testified"...; The
gathering, extinction, pleasure, trouble, and renunciation of the six touch
points...; five aggregates...; four major...; "Any collection of Dhamma is an
extinction", after knowing, ..., being said, ....

This was said by the Lord: "Bhikkhus! I teach the Dhamma with the wisdom of the
enlightenment, not without the wisdom; I teach the Dhamma by cause and
condition, not without cause and condition; I teach the Dhamma with divine
transformation, not without divine transformation, bhikkhus! When I teach the
Dhamma with wisdom wisdom, ..., (my) exhortation should be done; (my)
instruction should be done, bhikkhus! This is enough for you to be satisfied,
rejoicing, and delighted: the Blessed One is the Enlightened One, the Dhamma is
good, and the Saṅgha is one who walks according to goodness. [AN.3.126]" And
when this commentary was said, ten thousand worlds shook [DN.1, paragraph 149].

104. What is the cause for the desirable and undesirable? When what does not
     exist, do these not exist?
What is the truth of non-existence and existence, please tell me what is the
    cause for this.

"Where is the cause of the desirable and undesirable?": "Where is the cause of
the desirable and undesirable? Where are they born? ...." "He inquires about the
roots of the agreeable and undesirable...."

"When something does not exist, these do not exist": "When something does not
exist, when it is not known, they do not exist; when what is desirable and
undesirable are not discovered, they do not exist, do not occur, do not arise,
are not produced, to not arise, are not born."

"The truth of non-existence and existence": "What is a desirable and undesirable
existence? Any desirable and undesirable existence and occurrence, it arises, is
born, occurs, and appears. This is the existence of the desirable and
undesirable. What is the non-existence of the undesirable and undesirable? The
destruction, dissipation, impermanence, and disappearance of desirable and
undesirable. The non-existence of desirable and undesirable. "What is this
truth", whatever is the highest truth."

"Please tell me where is the cause of this": ""This", everything I ask;
...(omitted)." "Please tell me", "Please tell me, ...(omitted)." Please tell me
this." From where is the cause", where is the cause, where is the collection,
where is the birth, where is the root."

105. Desirable and undesirable, touches are the cause, and these do not exist
     when touch does not exist,
The truth of non-existence and existence, I tell you that this is the reason.

"Desirable and undesirable touch (contact) is its cause": The touch that should
feel pleasurable gives rise to joy, and the extinction of the touch that should
feel pleasurable corresponds to that feeling: the touch that should feel
pleasure arises the joy of it is destroyed; it is calmed down. Suffering arises
from the touch that should feel suffering, and the extinction of the touch that
should feel suffering corresponds to that feeling: the suffering that arises
from the touch that should feel suffering is destroyed; it is calmed down. It is
due to the feeling that the touch that is not painful or unhappy arises, and the
touch that is not painful or unpleasant should experience the extinction of the
touch that is not painful or unpleasant. Corresponding to the feeling that
should be felt: it is due to the feeling that the touch that is not suffering or
unhappy arises; it is not suffering or happy to be destroyed; it is calmed down.
"Desirable and undesirable contact is its cause": "Desirable and undesirable
contact is its cause; contact is its collection; contact is its birth; contact
is its root."

"These do not exist when the touch does not exist": "When the touch does not
exist, when it is not known, they do not exist; when it is not found, the
desirable and undesirable do not exist, do not occur, do not arise, are not
produced, are not born, do not appear."

"The reason for non-existence and existence": "The view of existence is always
the cause; the view of non-existence is also the cause." This truth" is the
highest truth."

"I tell you this, from here is the reason": ""This", whatever you ask; .... "I
tell", "I tell, ...." I tell you this. "From here is the cause", from here:
touch is its collection; touch is its birth; touch is its root."

106. Then what is the cause of touch in the world, and from where are there many
     things?
When what does not exist, is there no self-holding? When what has disappeared,
    is there no touch?

"So where does the touch in the world have its cause?" "Where does the touch
come from? ...." He asked the root of touch; ...."

"And where are there many things from?": ""Where do things come from? Where are
they born? ...." He asked about the root of all things; ...."

"When what does not exist, is there no self-holding (grasping to the wrong idea
of self)": "When something does not exist, it does not exist when it is not
known; when ego clinging does not exist, is not known, ..., burned by the fire
of wisdom."

"When what disappears, is there no touch": "When something disappears; when it
does not exist; when it has crossed; when it has passed; when it has been
overcome, there is no touch."

107. Contact (touch) is due to name and form, the reason for wanting is
     possession,
There is no self-attachment when wanting is non-existent, and there cannot be
    touch when the form has disappeared (alt: 'is clear'??).

"Contact is due to name and form": Eye-consciousness arises from the eye and
form. The three meet and touch. The eyes and the forms in the form (the forms
belonging to the form), in addition to the eye contact, also there are
corresponding dhammas in the name (belonging to the name), so that it is due to
the contact between name and form. Ears.... Nose.... Tongue.... Body....
(Mind-)Consciousness arises due to the mind and the Dhamma. When the three meet,
there is contact. (The mind) is in the material (the heart is in the heart
(??)). The formed dhammas are in the material. There are corresponding dhammas
in the name, so it is due to the contact between name and form.

"There is possession as the reason of wanting": Wanting is called craving, which
is greed, .... "Property", there are two kinds of possessions: the possessions
of thirst and possessions of seeing.... "The cause of wanting is possessions":
"Everything takes desire as its cause, desire as its reason, desire as its
condition, and desire as its root."

"When want is non-existent, there is no self-holding": Want is called craving,
.... There are two kinds of self-holdings: .... "When want is non-existent,
there is no ego-clinging": "When want is non-existent, is not known, is not
discovered, ego clinging does not exist..., has been cut off..., burned by the
fire of wisdom."

"When the form is understood, there will not be touch": "Form", ...(omitted).
"When the form is understood," the four forms of form are understood: by
knowing, understanding, measuring, cutting off, passing. How to be understood
based on what is known? He knows form: "Any forms, all forms are the four great
elements and created of the four great elements." He knows; when he sees, he is
made clear by knowing and understanding.

How to be understood by measuring clarity? After doing this, he measures form as
impermanent, bitter, sick, tumor, arrow, curse, disease, on the other side,
corrupt, disaster, evil, terror, calamity, movement, perishable, unstable, no
shelter, no refuge, no return, reluctant, hypocritical, empty, selfless, fault,
change, false, unfortunate root, killer, nothing, troublesome, promising (??),
magic food (bait), birth method, old age method, disease method, death method,
sorrow and despair method, pollution method, assembly (gathering), extinction,
pleasure (??), troubles, and renunciation, in this way it is to be understood by
measuring and understanding.

How to be made clear by cutting off of the form? After weighing in this way, the
desire for form, greed for others (??), he will let go, drive away, end, and
make it go to non-existence. This was said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus! All
the desires and greed about form will be cut off. In this way, that sex form be
cut off and the roots will be cut off, just like a palm tree without roots,
becoming non-being inanimate things fro the future. [SN.22.25]" In this way,
making clear by cutting off the form.

How to be understood by transcending the form? The Four Formless Abodes, the
forms are made clear (disappeared), made clear (destroyed), passed through,
passed over, and overcome, so that they are made clear by passing through. It is
understood by these four behaviors.

"When the form is understood, it cannot be touched": "When the form is
understood; when it is cleared; when it is crossed; when it is overcome, it
cannot be touched: eye contact, ear contact, nose..., tongue, body."

108. How does one understand (overcome) form? How to understand (overcome)
     happiness and suffering?
Please tell me this about understanding (overcoming). May we know this: this is
    my intention ('like this is what I mean'/'it is my intention to be like
    this'??).

"How to understand the form for the author (??)": "How is it for the author" how
is it; what is the way of the person; what is the action; what is the turn of
the person; what is the guardian (??); what is the last; how is the person who
keeps it clear; to be crossed; to be overtaken; to be overcome."

"How to understand happiness and suffering": "How to understand happiness and
suffering; make it clear; be crossed; be overcome."

"Please tell me this about understanding": ""This", "Whatever I ask; ..." This.
"Please tell me", "Please tell me, ...." Tell me about this. "About
understanding", about understanding to make it clear, to be crossed, to be
overcome."

"May we know this: it is my intention like this": ""May we know this", "May we
know this; let us know; may we not (??); may we know for sure; may we pass
through." Know this. "Like this is my intention", like this is my intention;
like this is my heart; like this is my consciousness."

109. He is a person does not think (through perceiving??), a person who does not
     think through desire, and a person who does not disappear (thinking),
This makes it clear for him, because the false name is thought to (wants to??)
    be the cause.

"He is a person who wants to live without thinking, and a person who wants to
think without thinking (??)": "A person who thinks and thinks (perceives?? )is
called someone who wants to live in the ordinary (natural) (consciousness??),
but he is not the person who wants to live in the ordinary. He who has (??)
thoughts is called a mad person and a person who has a confused mind, but he is
not a mad person, nor a person who has a confused heart."

"Neither the one who does not want to disappear": "Those who do not want to
disappear are called those who enter extinction and those who are without
thoughts, but he is not one who enters, nor is he one who does not want to
disappear. The one who wants to disappear is called the one who waits for the
four formless ones, but he is not the one who waits for the four formless ones."

"This is the way for the author to understand form": "Here, the bhikkhu is
disconnected... (omitted) after entering the fourth jhāna, when the mind is so
absorbed, fully pure, purified, and without the filthy, defiled, malleable,
suitable for work, standing or standing still, in order to obtain the limitless
void, he pulled out his heart (??) and turned to formless props (??)." This is
the author; In this way; the actor is like this; the one who makes it turn like
this; the guardian is like this; the one who keeps it is like this; the one who
keeps it is clear; make it clear; be traversed; be crossed; be overcome."

"Because the false name is its cause": "False is the name of falsehood: false
name of craving, false name of seeing, false name of conceit, thinking is its
cause; want is its collection; want is its birth; thinking is its root."

110. Whatever we ask you, you tell us; we want to ask you other things, come!
     Please tell about this,
Do some of the wise men here tell about this area: the first (foremost thing is)
    purity of Yakkha (spirit), or do they say other things (differently)?

"Whatever we ask you, you tell us": "What we ask you,  ... "You tell us", you
told, ...."

"We want to ask you about other things, come! Please tell about that": "We want
to ask you about other things; .... "Come! Please tell that", come! Please tell;
please explain; ...."

"Whether some wise men here tell this area (range??): the first (foremost is)
purity of Yakkha": "Some Samaṇa and Brahmins say, tell, talk, explain, say that
this formlessness, etc. is the first and the most successful, superior, top.
"Yakkha", sentient beings, .... "Pure", pure, clean, pure all over; detachment,
liberation, disengagement. "The wise men here", the wise speakers here, those
with firm words, those who (have) methods, (have) reasons, (have)
characteristics, (have) grounds, and those who make their own opinions
possible."

"Are they talking about other things": "Or are some Samaṇa and Brahmins who pass
through, cross over, overcome these formlessness and wait to speak, tell, talk,
explain, say that this formlessness, etc., there are other higher Yakkha. Are
they pure, clean, pure all over; detachment, liberation, disengagement?"

111. There are some wise men who tell about this area: the first (foremost)
     purity of Yakkha,
But there are some who claim to be skillful, and they tell that there is no
    remnant.

"There are certain sages here who tell about this scope: the first purity of
