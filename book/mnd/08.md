"(On) Encounter with the cleansed one, you will definitely not be able to move
forward": It is impossible for Pasūra, the marcher, to meet with the cleansed
one, Buddha, and Blessed One, rendezvous, discuss after the dispute, talk
together, and enter the discussion. What's the reason? The demonstrator Pasūra
is inferior, despicable, low, inferior intent, insignificant, and the Blessed
One is the first, the most triumphant, the superior, the uppermost, the supreme,
the highest. For example, it is impossible for a rabbit to meet with a drunk
elephant and compete after meeting; for example, it is impossible for a jackal
to compete with a lion, to meet together with the beast king, meet and compete
after meeting; ...a young, suckling calf cannot meet with a bull...; ...a crow
cannot meet with the golden-winged bird...; ...an outcast cannot meet with the
king...; ...a mud ghost cannot meet with Indra...; just like this, for the
marcher Pasūra it is impossible to meet, rendezvous, discuss after the
competition, talk together, and enter into discussions with the cleansed one,
Buddha, and Blessed One. What is the reason? The demonstrator Pasūra is the one
who is inferior, .... Those who benefit from wisdom, those who perceive wisdom,
those who are clever, those who have developed wisdom, those who have proven to
be unimpeded, those who have reached the four fearless ones, those who hold ten
powers, those who are like bulls, those who are like lions, those who are
virtuous people, those who have great wealth, those who have boundless wisdom,
those who have boundless brilliance, those who have boundless reputation, the
rich, the wealthy, the guides, the moderators, the comforters, the informers,
those who make them consider, those who make them see, the one who makes it
clear, the Blessed One is indeed the founder of the unborn Path, the producer of
the unborn Path, the unannounced preacher; the one who knows the Path; in
addition, (His) disciples now live in the companionship of the Path, and will be
those who possess it in the future.

The Blessed One is indeed he Knower and Seer, who knows and sees; he is the one
who is born with eyes, is born with wisdom, is born with Dhamma, and is born
with Brahma; is an interpreter and promoter of righteousness, the immortal
giver, Dhamma King, Tathāgata, there is no one that the Blessed One does not
know, does not see, unknown, does not testify, does not touch with wisdom, the
past, the future, and the present come to the Buddha with all the deeds. In the
field of wisdom, any dhamma that should be guided to reason can be known: one's
own righteousness or other people's righteousness or both, or the current
righteousness or the righteousness of the next life or both, or deep or secret,
or should be led to infer, or have been led to determine, or no-fault or
pollution-free, or clear and pure or supreme interest, they all turn around in
the Buddha's wisdom.

All body kamma is transferred in the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One;
all language kamma...; all mental kamma...; the wisdom of the Buddha and the
Blessed One about the past is barrier-free; ..future...; ...present...; all that
should be guided to infer is the reach of wisdom; all wisdom is guided to be
inferred, and all that should be guided to be inferred is the ultimate wisdom;
the ultimate wisdom is what is guided to be deduced, and there is no wisdom
beyond what is guided to be deduced; there is no way to transcend the wisdom
that is guided and deduced. These dhammas live in mutual restriction, such as
two boxes, where the covers are completely in contact; the lower cover does not
go over the upper one, and the upper cover does not go over the lower one;
restricted to each other. (Similarly, ) All that should be guided.. (omitted);
these dhammas live in mutual restriction.

The wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred in all the Dhamma,
all the Dhamma is the Buddha, the Blessed One's turning is to belong, the hope
is to belong, the intention is to belong, the mind is to arise, the wisdom of
the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred to all living beings, the Blessed
One Know the intentions of all living beings, know the potential tendency of
troubles, know the behavior, know the solution, know about the less dusty, the
more dusty; the rooted, the dull rooted, the good deeds, the evil deeds, and the
teachability and unteachability of beings; capable and incapable sentient
beings, including the world of heaven, demon, and Brahman; generations of
Samaṇa, Brahman, heaven, and man all revolve in the wisdom of the Buddha.

Just as all fish, turtles, and even big fish swallowing boats revolve in the
sea, the same is true of the world including heaven, demon, and Brahman;
generations including Samaṇa, brahman, heaven, and human all revolve in the
wisdom of Buddha. Such as any bird and even the golden-winged birds turned
around in the field of space. In the same way, those who have the same wisdom as
Sāriputta also revolve around in the field of Buddha wisdom. The wisdom of the
Buddha is pervasive and transcends heaven and human (worlds).

Those wise khattiya, wise brāhmaṇas, wise homeowners (laypeople), wise Samaṇa,
wise dissidents, sharp breakers who want to do evil views with a wise attitude,
they prepare problems later to see and ask hidden and secret questions of the
Tathāgata; those questions were discussed and answered by the Blessed One with
reasons, (and they) abandoned them, and became the (disciples) of the Blessed
One. At that time, the Blessed One was there to shine with wisdom. [Ps.21]
