# Introduction

The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravāda Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikāya (the 'small' or 'miscellaneous'
collection) in the Sutta Piṭaka (the basket of discourses). It is a commentary
on parts of the Sutta Nipāta (section of suttas), and is attributed to Venerable
Sāriputta (Pāli; Sanskrit Śāriputra). There are two parts:

* The Mahā Niddesa (Nd 1), a commentary on the Atṭḥaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Cūlạ Niddesa (Nd 2), a commentary on the Pārāyana Vagga (Sn 5) and the
  Khaggavisānạ Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutta, Sn 1.3)

While this text is a commentary on sections of the Sutta Nipāta, there's no need
to be familiar with that work first, as the verses commented on are translated
here.

## About This Translation

There has never been a complete English language translation before. After
asking around online, I got [an
answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that pointed me to a
Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation. Not knowing
Sinhala or Chinese, I automated translations using a bit of code, and took these
translations and wrangled them into this translation. There will likely be many
errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in this early edition. Several
Romanizations of the Pāli are available, and may inform future corrections and
revisions.

This translation prefers Pāli over Sanskrit terms (Dhamma vs. Dharma, kamma vs.
karma, etc.). To paraphrase Engels, changing the words we use a bit won't change
the things themselves. I have also omitted and abbreviated, for readability,
stanzas which were repeated verbatim.

Included verse numbers are numbers of the verses as presented in the two parts
of the Niddesa itself. Including separate verse numbers for each sutta, their
places in the Sutta Nipāta, and/or chapter their chapters, would lead to a
confusing mess, so I've chosen to omit them. Most of the suttas are less than
twenty verses, so correlating verses between the Niddesa and different
translations of the Sutta Nipāta should be straightforward for the reader.

References to other texts are in square brackets and use the common
abbreviations (Jat., Dhp., etc.); statements of who is speaking a given stanza
are also in square brackets; comments, clarifications, and marks of unclear
passages by myself or from my sources are in parentheses.

## Credits and Licenses

### Text

The Chinese was translated by [Zhuang
Chunjiang](https://agama.buddhason.org/Ni/Ni1.htm); no license copyright notice
was found.

The Sinhala used to cross-check the translation from the Chinese was sourced
from [Sutta
Central](https://github.com/suttacentral/sc-data/tree/5c060c479f4cb17a0891011d57d4933c81918ead/html_text/si/pli/sutta/kn)
and was originally translated by A. P. de Zoyza.

In addition, the translations of the Sutta Nipāta by Viggo Fausböll and Bhikkhu
Bodhi have been valuable references (if I had known about Bhikkhu Bodhi's
translation before starting this project, I may have never committed to it!), as
well as various Pāli dictionaries and glossaries, and Sutta Central's full
offline archive.
