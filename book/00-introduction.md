# Introduction

The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravāda Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikāya (the 'small' or 'miscellaneous'
collection) in the Sutta Piṭaka (the basket of discourses). It is a commentary
on parts of the Sutta Nipāta (section of suttas), and is attributed to Venerable
Sāriputta (Pāli; Sanskrit Śāriputra), though was likely finalized a few hundred
years after his death. There are two parts:

* The Mahā Niddesa (Nd 1), a commentary on the Atṭḥaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Cūlạ Niddesa (Nd 2), a commentary on the Pārāyana Vagga (Sn 5) and the
    Khaggavisānạ Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutta, Sn 1.3)

While this text is a commentary on sections of the Sutta Nipāta, there's no need
to be familiar with that work first, as the verses commented on are translated
here. At the same time, if you are just a casual reader interested in the early
suttas, I would recommend reading one of the translations of the Sutta Nipāta
instead; this is a somewhat technical commentary intended for scholars and
deeper understanding of the suttas, and may be too detailed and dry for the
casual reader.

## About This Translation

This is the first complete English language translation. After asking around
online, I got [an answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that
pointed me to a Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation.
Not knowing Sinhala or Chinese, I automated translations using a bit of code,
and took these translations and wrangled them into the first edition. As the
work progressed I referenced Pāli Romanizations more and more, with the help of
some dictionaries. For the second edition I re-translated from the Chinese and
fixed and expanded many passages.

**Important note**: To be very clear, I do not know Pāli _at all_, nor do I know
Sinhala, and I know a few words in Mandarin. At least 70% of this translation
was done by computers. The bulk of my work has been rectifying these various
machine translations with the help of dictionaries.

This translation prefers Pāli over Sanskrit terms (dhamma vs. dharma, kamma vs.
karma, etc.). If you're used to the Sanskrit terms — to paraphrase Engels,
changing the words we use a bit won't change the things themselves. The Chinese
variously translates Bhagavā as _Lord_, _World-Honored One_, and _Blessed One_,
and other English translations will also sometimes just write _Bhagavāt_; I've
chosen to use _Blessed One_ because I like the feel of it. I have also chosen
not to capitalize pronouns when referring to the Buddha, as I feel that creates
too much of a god-like air; Christians capitalize pronouns when referring to
their god, but the Buddha was not a god, he was a human teacher. Capitalization
of the word _dhamma_ is more or less at my discretion — this is always difficult
since _dhamma_ could refer to a method, the Method, a fact, anything that
exists, the Truth, a law, the Law, etc.; hopefully I haven't made too many
mistakes here.

For readability, I have omitted concluding sentences of each paragraph when they
simply repeat the first sentence, and concluding repetitions after the
explanation of each verse. I have also omitted some repetitions of lists within
the same chapter, indicated by ellipses or an "(omitted)" in the text. In rare
cases I have omitted frequently-repeated passages that occur in earlier
chapters, indicated the same way.

Included verse numbers are numbers of the verses as presented in the two parts
of the Niddesa itself. Including separate verse numbers for each sutta, their
places in the Sutta Nipāta, and/or chapter their chapters, would lead to a
confusing mess, so I've chosen to omit them. Most of the suttas are less than
twenty verses, so correlating verses between the Niddesa and different
translations of the Sutta Nipāta should be straightforward for the reader.

References to other texts were primarily added in the Chinese version and are in
square brackets using common abbreviations (DN, Jat., etc.); statements of who
is speaking a given stanza are also in square brackets; I have put comments,
clarifications, and marks of unclear passages in parentheses.

### Text

The Chinese was translated by [Zhuang
Chunjiang](https://agama.buddhason.org/Ni/Ni1.htm). The Sinhala was translated
by A. P. de Zoyza and hosted by [Sutta
Central](https://github.com/suttacentral/sc-data/tree/5c060c479f4cb17a0891011d57d4933c81918ead/html_text/si/pli/sutta/kn).
Two Romanizations of the Pāli were used, one from [Sutta
Central](https://github.com/suttacentral/legacy-suttacentral-data/tree/384ab0b63a521946cddb343319ac6c325dd2fb27/text/pi/su/kn)
and one from [Tipitaka.org](https://tipitaka.org/).

In addition, the translations of the Sutta Nipāta by Viggo Fausböll and Bhikkhu
Bodhi have been valuable references (if I had known about Bhikkhu Bodhi's
translation before starting this project, I may have never committed to it!), as
well as various Pāli dictionaries.
