    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p>There has never been a complete English language translation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niddesa">the Niddesa</a>. After asking on Stack Exchange, I got <a href="https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522">an answer</a> that pointed me to a Sinhala translation, which I figured I could use to automate an English translation. I then also found a complete Chinese translation and did the same thing with that.</p>
    <p>It will take work and time to clean up the generated translations and make them readable. In the future I may try to learn Pali and do a fresh translation from the source (see those files in this repo, or the Pali Text Society's Romanizations on the Internet Archive).</p>
    <h3 id="the-text">The Text</h3>
    <p>The auto-generated translations were done using Google and Amazon's translation services. The Yandex and IBM Watson translations were terrible, not worth trying to use.</p>
    <p>./text/book contains the contents. If you find a problem or want to help, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/niddesa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">submit an issue</a>. See ./TODO.md for current tasks. ./text/pali is for future reference.</p>
    <h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>
    <p>To try the translation code for yourself, see <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/translate-batches">this repo</a></p>
    <p>To build assets, run <code>make</code>. You will need various dependencies: make, pandoc, a LaTeX setup including xetex (mactex or texlive-xetex, depending on your platform), as well as the Cardo font.</p>
    <h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
