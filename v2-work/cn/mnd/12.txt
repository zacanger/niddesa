　　Second , the instructions for configuring the Xiaojing will say:
　　113. Those who have seen each other, and those who are skilled after
holding them, tell them in various ways:
　　　Anyone who knows this will find the Dharma, and those who reject
this will be incomplete. By.
　　"Stayers of their own views": "Some ascetic and Brahmins arethose
with bad views. After they have grasped, grasped, picked up, grasped,
and attached to one of the sixty-two bad views, they Individuals live
together, live together, live in, and abide (everywhere), such as living
in the family home, or living in sin, or living in defilement.
Similarly, some ascetic and brahmins are Those with evil views, after
they hold, grasp, pick up, grasp, and cling to one of the sixty-two evil
views, they abide, live together, abide, and abide in their respective
views ( pervasive).” For the stayers who see each other.
　　"After grasping, the skilled people inform in various ways": "'After
grasping,' after grasping, after grasping, after picking up, after
grasping, after clinging, they inform in various ways; they inform in
many ways; they [conflict with each other] ] tell; they tell
individually; they don't tell (speak) differently, they tell, they talk,
they explain, they talk. "Skillful ones," skillful talkers, wise talkers
, a firm speaker, a speaker with a method, a speaker with a reason, a

know, see, and penetrate the Dharma, see, trace, and Tao will discover
the Dharma."
　　"He who rejects this is imperfect": "Whoever rejects Dhamma, view,
path, and path is imperfect; he is unfinished; he is imperfect; he is
inferior, inferior, inferior the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior-minded, the insignificant." To reject this he is the imperfect.
　　Because of that, Huarensaid:
　　"Those who have stayed in their own eyes, and those who have grasped
it, have been told in various ways:
　　　Whoever knows this will find the Dharma, and whoever rejects it
will be incomplete."
　　114. After holding it in this way, they argue , and say "the
opponent is the fool, the unskillful",
　　　then which of these people is true? Because these people are all
professing skillful ones.
　　"After grasping like this, they argue": "After grasping, grasping,
picking up, clinging, clinging, they argue, quarrel, argue, argue,
argue, disagree: 'You don't know This law, the law... (abbreviated in
the middle) or please untie it, if you can."" They argued after holding
it in this way.
　　"And say 'the adversary is the fool, the unskillful'": "'The
adversary is the fool, the inferior, the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior, the inferior, the trivial, the unskillful, the ignorant, the
ignorant, the ignorant Those who are indistinguishable, those who are
not wise, those who are not wise.” Speak like this; tell like this; talk
like this; explain like this;
　　"Then which one of these speakers is true": "Which one of these
recluses and brahmins is true, truthful, genuine, factual, correct, and
unreversed?" So which one of these speakers is true? .
　　"Because these people are all proclaiming skillful ones": "These
ascetics and brahmins are all skillful talkers, wise talkers, firm
talkers, [have] methods, [have] The talker of reasons, the talker of
[having] characteristics, the talker of grounds, the talker of their own
assertions as possible.” For these are all those who claim to be skillful.
　　Because of that, Huaren said:
　　"After holding it in this way, they argue and say, 'The opponent is
the fool, the unskillful',
　　　so which of these people is telling the truth? Because all of
these people claim to be skillful."
　　115. If If he does not recognize the Dharma of his opponent, he is a
fool, a fool (Ceylon version), a despicable and wise person,
　　　then all are fools, extremely despicable and wise: all these
people are stoppers of seeing.
　　"If you don't agree with your opponent's Dharma": "When your
opponent's Dharma, views, Taoist traces, Taoism, he doesn't approve,
doesn't follow, doesn't agree (anānumanato?), doesn't agree, doesn't
like it." Law.
　　"He is the fool, the fool (Ceylon), the lowly wise": "The opponent
is the fool, the lowly, the lowly, the lowly, the lowly, the
lowly-minded, the insignificant, the lowly wise, the lowly wise, the
lowly The wise, the lowly wise, the low-minded wise, the trivial wise."
For he is the fool, the fool (Ceylon), the lowly wise.
　　"Then they are all fools, the most despicable and wise": "These
ascetics and brahmins are all fools, inferior, inferior, inferior,
inferior, inferior in intention, insignificant, all inferior in wisdom,
inferior in wisdom, The lowly wise, the lowly wise, the low-minded wise,
the trivial wise.” Then they are all fools, extremely lowly wise.
　　"These people are all view-stoppers": "These ascetics and brahmins
are all evil-viewers. They hold, grasp, pick up, cling to, and cling to
one of the sixty-two evil views. Afterwards, they live, live together,
live, and abide (pervasively) in their respective sees, such as in the
family's home, or the sinner lives in sin, or the defiler lives in
defilement. In the same way, these Recluses and Brahmins are all those
who have bad views... (abbreviated in the middle) stay (pervasive)."
Because these people are all stayers of view.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"If he does not approve of his opponent's Dhamma, and he is a fool,
a fool (Ceylon),
　　　a vile and wise man, then all are fools, utterly vile and wise:
all these people are stoppers of seeing."
　　116 .But if by one's own view one becomes innocent (Thai version),
one who is completely pure, one who is skillful, one who is enlightened,
　　　then there will be none of those who are of inferior wisdom,
because those who see are as complete as they are.
　　"But if you become innocent with your own views (Thailand version)":
"With your own views, with your own likes, with your own hobbies, with
your own opinions, become {not} innocent, {not} pure, {not}bright, [not]
polluted, [not] polluted." For but if you become innocent in your own
eyes (Thailand version).
　　"Perfectly pure wisdom, skillful, enlightened wisdom": "'Perfectly
pure wisdom, pure wisdom, pervasive pure wisdom, pure white wisdom, pure
wisdom, or, pure seer, pure seer, pervasive The pure seer, the pure
white seer, the bright seer' is the one who is completely pure and wise.
The "skillful one", "the skillful one is the wise, the wise, the
supernatural, the wise, the wise, the wise." Those who are completely
pure and skillful. "Aware of wisdom", those who are enlightened are the
wise, the wise, the supernatural, the wise, the wise, and the wise."
Those who are completely pure, skillful, Wisdom.
　　"Then there is none of those who are of inferior wisdom": "Those
ascetics and brahmins who do not have any inferior, inferior, inferior,
inferior, inferior in intention, and insignificant, are all supreme. The
wise, the supremely wise, the supreme wise, the supreme wise, the
supreme wise." So there is no inferior wise among those people.
　　"Because the vision of those people has been completed like that":
"The vision of those ascetics and brahmins has been completed, grasped,
grasped, grasped, attached, grasped, believed and understood." Because
The seeing of those people is done like that.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"But if by one's own view one is innocent (Thai version), one who is
completely pure, one who is skillful, one who is enlightened,
　　　then there will be none of those who are of inferior wisdom,
because those people's view is like that It's done."
　　117. I don't say "this is the truth": whenever they say to each
other that the opponent is a fool,
　　　they take their opinion to be true, so they call the opponent "the
fool."
　　"I don't say 'this is the truth'": "'No' is negative. 'This',
'Sixty-two bad views, this is truthful, true, factual, correct, not
upside down.' I don't tell (say) , I don't explain, I don't teach, I
don't tell, I don't build, I don't reveal, I don't parse, I don't
clarify, I don't explain." For I don't say "this is the truth."
　　"Whoever they say to each other is an adversary is a fool": "The
adversary is two men, two quarrellers, two disputants, two disputants,
two disputants, two contenders, two disputants , two interlocutors, they
say to each other this, this talk, this talk, this explanation, this
speech [the antagonist] is the fool, the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior, the inferior, the inferior-minded, the insignificant.” For
whoever they say to each other is an adversary is a fool.
　　"They take their own views to be true": "The world is eternal, this
is true, everything else is empty. ' to make their own views true for
them. "The world is very permanent, this is the reality, and the rest
are empty."... (Abbreviated in the middle) "The Tathagata neither exists
nor does not exist after death, this is the reality, and the rest are
empty." They take their own views to be true.
　　"Therefore they regard their opponents as 'fools'": "'therefore',
therefore; that reason; that cause; that condition; that cause, they
regard, see, see, watch, contemplate, observe their opponents as fools,
inferiors, The mean, the inferior, the low, the low-minded, the
insignificant." For this reason they call their opponents "The Fool."
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"I do not say 'this is the truth': whoever they say to each other
that the adversary is a fool,
　　　they take their opinion to be true, and therefore they call the
adversary 'the fool'."
　　118. Where some say Those who are "truthful, truthful", others say
"that is false, false," and
　　　after holding it like this, they argue, why don't the ascetics
tell it all?
　　"Anyone who says 'truth, truth'": "Every dharma, view, path, path,
some ascetic and brahmin say this, say this, say this, explain this, say
this: 'This is true , truthful, true, factual, correct, not
confounded.'" For those who say "true, truthful" by some.
　　"Others say 'that is false, false'": "On that Dharma, view, path,
path, some ascetics and brahmins say this, tell this, talk this way,
explain this way, say this way: 'This is It's false, it's false, it's
not true, it's false, it's not true."" Saying "that's false, false" for
others.
　　"After grasping like this, they argue": "After grasping, grasping,
picking up, clinging, clinging, they argue, quarrel, argue, argue,
argue, disagree: 'You don't know This law, the law... (abbreviated in
the middle) or please untie it, if you can."" They argued after holding
it in this way.
　　"Why didn't the ascetics tell them all": "'Why', why? What is the
reason? What is the cause? What is the relationship? What is the cause?
They do not tell in one way; they inform in various ways; they inform in
many ways; they inform each other [conflictingly]; they inform (speak)
individually, they tell, they tell, they explain, they tell." Are they
different?
　　Because of that, Huaren said,
　　"Where some people say 'truth, truth,' and others say 'that is
false, false,'
　　　after holding it in this way, they argue, why don't the ascetics
tell the same thing?"
　　119 Indeed , there is no single truth, there is no second one, and
those who know it should not argue about anything. All these
　　　truths are applauded by themselves, so the ascetics do not tell
them differently.
　　"Indeed there is no single truth, there is no second": "The single
truth is called the cessation of suffering, nirvana, the cessation of
all actions, the cessation of allattachments, the cessation of craving,
thecessation of craving, the cessation of nirvana, and the cessation of
all attachments. Or, The single truth is called the truth of the path,
the truth of renunciation, the path leading to the path of suffering,
the Noble Eightfold Path, namely: Right View, Right Will, Right Speech,
Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right
Concentration." There is no second.
　　"Those who understand should not argue about anything": "'Whatever',
whatever reality. 'Man', a synonym for all beings. 'Understanding',
whoever truly understands , those who know, those who know, those who
know, those who penetrate should not quarrel, should not argue, should
not argue, should not argue, should not argue, quarrel, argue, argue,
argue, disagree He should give up, he should drive away, he should end
it, he should bring it to non-existence." The one who understands should
not argue about anything.
　　"All kinds of realities they applaud themselves": "All kinds of
those realities they applaud, inform, talk about, talk about, explain,
say; 'The world is constant, this is what is real, and everything else
is empty.' They themselves Applaud, inform, talk about, talk about,
explain, speak; the world is very constant... (Abbreviated in the
middle) "The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death,
this is the real thing, and the rest is empty." They applauded
themselves. , tell, talk, talk, explain, talk." They applaud themselves
for all those realities.
　　"Therefore the ascetics do not tell them uniformly": "'Therefore',
therefore; that reason; that cause; that condition; that cause they tell
not uniformly; They tell (speak) individually, they tell, they tell,
they explain, they tell." So the ascetics do not tell differently.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said,
　　"There is indeed a single truth and there is no second. Those who
understand should not argue about anything.
　　　They applaud all their own truths, so the ascetics do not tell
them all."
　　120. Why do they tell all truths ? : A good talker, a proclaimer of
skill?
　　　Are those truths numerous and various, or do they follow inferences?
　　"Why do they tell the truth": "'Why', why? What is the reason? What
is the cause? What is the cause? What is the cause? conflict]; they tell
truths, they tell, they talk, they explain, they speak." Why do they
tell truths.
　　"talkers, proclaimers of skill": "'talkers', 'they refute' are
talkers, or they say, talk, talk, explain, say their own views: 'The
world is eternal, This is the truth, and everything else is empty." They
say, talk, talk, explain, talk; the world is very permanent...
(Abbreviated in the middle) "The Tathagata neither exists nor does not
exist after death, this is the truth all else is vain.” They say, talk,
talk, explain, talk. 'Declare the skillful,' the skillful talker, the
wise talker, the solid talker, [there is] The speaker of the method, the
speaker of the reason, the speaker of the characteristic, the speaker of
the basis, the speaker of his own opinion as possible." As a good
talker, Claim to be skillful.
　　"Whether those realities are many, various": "Whether those
realities are many, various, multifaceted, [conflicting], individual."
Is whether those realities are many and various.
　　"Still they follow inferences": "Or they carry, carry, carry, carry
with inferences, thoughts." So it is still they follow inferences. Or,
"They are influenced by inferences, they are examined and followed, and
they speak, talk, talk, explain, speak with their own eloquence." And so
they still follow inferences.
　　Because of that, Huaren said:
　　"Why do they tell the truths: the talkative, the proclaiming skillful?
　　　Are those truths many and many, or do they follow inferences?"
　　121. The truth is indeed not many and many, except He recognizes
that there are permanent things in the world,
　　　but after inferences and conclusions, they say that there are two
kinds of things, "true and false".
　　"It is true that the truth is not numerous and various": "It is true
that the truth is not many, various, multifaceted, [conflicting],
individual." It is true that the truth is not many and various.
　　"Except after he recognizes the permanent things in the world":
"Except after he recognizes the permanent attachment, there is only a
single truth in the world that is talked about, talked about, explained,
spoken: the cessation of suffering, Nirvana, the cessation of all
actions. , the renunciation of all attachments, the cessation of
craving, the cessation of greed, the cessation of nirvana, the cessation
of craving, the cessation of craving, the cessation of nirvana. Or, the
single truth is called the truth of the path, the truth of renunciation,
the path leading to the path of suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path,
namely: Right View... ... (abbreviated in the middle) right
concentration." Except after he recognized the permanent things in the
world.
　　"But after the inference and determination on the view, they say
that there are two kinds of 'true and false'": "Thinking, thinking,
thinking After thinking, thinking, thinking, after thinking, so that
evil views arise, produce, arise, give birth; cause evil views to arise,
give birth, arise, and after they give birth, they say this, talk this
way, talk this way, explain this way, say this way: 'Mine is true, yours
is false. After the above inferences and conclusions, they said that
there are two kinds of methods, "true and false".
　　Because of that, the World-Honored One said:
　　"The truth is indeed not numerous or various, except that after he
has recognized the things that are permanent in the world,
　　　but after inferences and conclusions, they say that there are two
kinds of dharmas, 'true and false'."
　　122 In terms of seeing, hearing, precepts and prohibitions or
perceptions, rely on these and become the seers of contempt,
　　　stand up in judgment and become the laughing ones, and say that
the opponent is "the fool, the unskillful".
　　"In what is seen, what is heard, the precepts, and what is forbidden
or felt, rely on these and become a contemptuous seer": "'The purity of
what is seen or seen; The purity of prohibition; the purity of
perception or perception, after relying, after relying, after picking
up, after clinging, after clinging." It is in what is seen, heard,
disciplined and forbidden or perceived. "Abide by these Afterwards he
becomes a seer of contempt", "disrespectful" is a seer of contempt, or
"causing sorrow" is also a seer of contempt." After stopping this, he
became a contemptuous seer.
　　“Become a laugher after standing in judgment”: “‘Judgment is called
the sixty-two evil views [judgment of view], after standing, after
establishing, after picking up , after clinging, after clinging.' is
after standing in judgment. 'becoming one who laughs', one who is
delighted, one who laughs, one who delights, one who is pleasing, one
who is completely satisfied, or one who continues to laugh with teeth
showing." To be a laugher after standing in judgment.
　　"And say that the adversary is the 'fool, the unskillful'": "'The
adversary is the fool, the inferior, the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior, the inferior, the insignificant, the unskillful, the ignorant,
the ignorant, the ignorant Those who are indiscriminate (those who are
not wise), those who are not wise.” Say this; tell this way; talk this
way; explain this way;
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"In what you see, what you hear, the precepts and prohibitions, or
what you perceive, rely on these and become the seers of contempt,
　　　stand up in judgment and become the laughing ones, and say that
the opponent is 'the fool, the unskillful one'. ’.”
　　123. Just because he called his opponent a “foolish man,” he called
himself a “skillful one,”
　　　using himself [saying] himself as a proclaimed skillful one, and
despising others, he said that.
　　"Because he regards his opponent as a 'fool'": "Just because of that
cause, with that condition, with that reason, with that root cause he
identifies, sees, sees, watches, contemplates, observes his opponent as
a fool, an inferior, a despicable the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior, the inferior-minded, the insignificant." Because he called his
opponent "The Fool".
　　"Therefore he says he is a 'skillful one'": "Oneself (Ātumāno) is
called himself (attā). He also [says] himself by that cause, by that
condition, by that reason, by that source: I am good. The ingenious, the
wise, the wise, the enlightened, the wise, the wise, the wise." That's
why he calls himself a "skillful".
　　"By himself [says] himself he becomes a proclaimed skillful one":
"Just by himself [says] himself as a skillful one, a wise one, a firm
one, [a] methodical one the speaker, the speaker who [has] reason, the
speaker who [has] the characteristic, the speaker who [has] the basis,
the speaker who makes his own claims possible.” In order to [say]
himself he becomes Claim to be skillful.
　　"To despise other people he says like that": "'Disrespect' is to
despise others, or 'to make it sad' is also to despise others. 'He said
like that', he said that evil like that See: like this, this person is a
wrong-viewer, an upside-down one." He said like that in order to despise
others.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"Just because he called his opponent a 'fool', he said he was a
'skillful one',
　　　with himself [saying] himself he became a professed skillful one,
and despising others he said that."
　　124. He was completed by the transgressed view, slowly intoxicated
into a self-proclaimed perfectionist, and empowered
　　　by his own mind, because his vision was completed like that.
　　"He is completed by the transgressed view": The transgressed view is
called the sixty-two evil views. For what reason is the transgressed
view called the sixty-two evil views? All these views have surpassed the
reason, the characteristic, and the possibility, and the transgressed
view for this reason is called the sixty-two evil views. All views are
transgressions. For what reason are all views called transgressive
views? They cross, cross, and overcome each other, and they cause evil
views to arise; they produce, they arise, and they arise, and for this
reason all views are called transgressive views. "He was completed by
the transgressed view": "He was completed, filled, perfected by the
transgressed view." Completed for his transgressed view.

　　"Because that image of his view has been completed like that": "That
image of his has been completed, held, grasped, grasped, attached,
grasped, believed and understood." Because of his That seeing is done
like that.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"He is completed by the transgressed view, he is slowly intoxicated
into a self-proclaimed perfectionist, and
　　　he is empowered by his own mind, because that image of his is
completed like that."
　　125. For the opponent, if because of To be a mean one by words, he
himself [also] becomes a mean one of wisdom,
　　　but if [he] himself is one who knows the Vedas, one who is wise,
there is no fool among the ascetics.
　　"To an opponent, if he becomes a mean person because of his words":
"To his opponent, if he is [because of] because of his words, the reason
for the rebuke, the reason for the scolding, the reason for the insult,
the opponent [then] becomes a fool, a mean person, a mean person Those
who are inferior, those who are inferior, those who are inferior, those
who have inferior intentions, those who are insignificant.” For the
opponent to be inferior because of words. "Then he himself [also]
becomes a lowly wise man": "He also becomes a lowly wise man, a lowly
wise man, a lowly wise man, a lowly wise man, a lowly intentional man of
wisdom, and an insignificant man of wisdom because of that." He himself
[also] became the mean and wise one together.
　　"But if [he] himself is the Vedic, the wise": "But if [he] himself

ascetic, the inferior, the inferior, the inferior, the inferior, the
inferior, the insignificant, and all are the most wise, the supremely
wise, the superior The first wise man, the supreme wise man, the supreme

　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"If an opponent becomes a mean person because of words, he himself
[also] becomes a mean person with wisdom,
　　　but if [he] himself is a Vedic, a wise one, he is among the
ascetic. There are no fools."
　　126. Those who tell other dharmas from here [outside] are pure
errant ones, imperfect ones,
　　　and so are all kinds of heretics, because they are tainted by the
greed of their own opinions.
　　"Whoever informs other dharmas from here [outside], they are pure
misses, imperfect ones": "Whoever informs other dharmas, views, path
traces, paths from here, they are the pure path, the pure path, the
ubiquitous pure The lost, the lost, the lost, the lost, the lost in
perfect wisdom, they are incomplete; they are incomplete; they are
incomplete; they are inferior , the inferior, the inferior, the

　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"Those who tell other Dhammas from here [outside] are pure errant
ones, imperfect ones,
　　　and so do all kinds of heretics, because they are tainted by the
greed of their own views."
　　127. They tell "it's pure here", they say that there is no purity in
other dharmas, and
　　　all kinds of heretics are fixed in this way, claiming to be strong
there in their own way.
　　"They tell 'only here is pure'": "They tell, talk, talk, explain,
talk here is pure, pure, universally pure; freed, liberated, universally
freed: 'The world is eternal, this is the truth The rest are empty.”
They told, talked, talked, explained, and said that here is pure, pure,
and universally pure; freed, liberated, and universally freed; the world
is very permanent... There is neither existence nor non-existence, this
is real, everything else is emptiness.” They told, talked, talked,
explained, said that here is pure, pure, universally pure; freed,
liberated, universally freed.” For them "Only here is pure".
　　"They say that there is no purity in other dharmas": "He renounces,
uproots, and surrounds all dissent, except for the group, views, traces,
and paths of his own master, which is narrated by the dharma: 'The
master is not all wise, and the dharma does not It is said by the good,
[their] group is not a good person, seeing is not good, the path is not
established by good, the path is not detached, there is no purity here,
or pure, or all pure, or detachment, or liberation, or Universally
freed, no where they become pure, or pure, or universally pure, or
freed, or liberated, or universally freed, inferior, inferior, inferior,
inferior, inferior Intentional, trivial." They say so, talk about it,
talk about it, explain it, say it so." Because they say there is no
purity in other dharmas.
　　"The various heretics are thus fixed": "The sects are called evil
views, and the heretics are called those of evil views, fixed, stopped,
clinging, entered, defiled, Turn your heart toward it." This is also
fixed for all kinds of heretics.
　　"There is one who declares strong in his own way": "The law is his
own way; the sight is his own way; the signs are his own way; the word
is his own way, and the steadfast talker in his own way, The strong
talker, the strong talker, the established talker." To be there in his
own way to claim solidity.
　　Because of that, the Blessed One said:
　　"They told 'it is pure here only', and they said that there is no
purity in other dharmas, and the
　　　heretics of all kinds are thus fixed, claiming to be strong there
in their own way."
　　128. But in their own way. On the road to claim the sturdy, what
opponent can he call "The Fool" here?
　　　It is he himself who brings dissent: the opponent is a fool's
talker of impure laws.
　　"But he who proclaims firmness in his own way": "My own law, my own
vision, my own path, my own way, in my own way a firm speaker, a firm
speaker, a strong speaker The one who is established, the one who is
established." For Dan, the one who proclaims firmness in his own way.

speaks of the impure law": "'The adversary is the fool, the inferior,
the inferior, the inferior, the inferior, the inferior-minded, the
trivial, the impure Those who do not purify the Dharma, those who do not
pervade the pure Dharma, those who do not purify the Dharma.” Those who
say this, those who speak this way, those who talk this way, those who
explain this way, those who speak this way will bring it; they will
