completely, completely, in every way, without remainder, whole, this is
the word of universal grasping, "everything". "Shengren", living beings

not fear, they do not fear, they do not come to fear, and for this
reason they are called the strong. "Cudgel", there are three kinds of
sticks: the stick of the body, the stick of speech, and the stick of
mind. There are three kinds of sticks for the body, four kinds of sticks
for bad words, and three kinds of sticks for intentional acts. "After
laying down the club for all living beings": After laying down and
setting aside the club for all living beings.
　　"None of them will be harmed": "A sentient being does not use clods,
or sticks, or swords, or chains, or ropes to harm all sentient beings.
With the sword, or with the chain, or with the rope." For neither of
them will be hurt.
　　"Shouldn't want a son to have company from where": "No" is negative.
"Son", there are four kinds of sons: the son of oneself, the son of the
field, the son of the adopted son, and the son of the apprentice.
"Companion," with whom he walks happily, comes pleasantly, associates
pleasantly, stands pleasantly, sits pleasantly, sleeps pleasantly,
speaks pleasantly, converses pleasantly, talks pleasantly, and is
pleasantly interlocated called companions. "Should not want a son from
where have a companion": "A son should also not want, should not
receive, should not hope, should not ask, where should a son should
want, should receive, should hope, should ask for a friend, or
acquaintance , or a close one, or a companion." For should not want a
son Where can a companion come from?
　　"One should walk alone like the horn of a rhinoceros": "'Alone,' the
enlightened one is alone in the name of renunciation, alone in the
righteousness of being without a partner, alone in the righteousness of
renunciation of craving, "always free from greed" ' is alone, "always
freed from hatred" is alone, "always freed from delusion" is alone,
"always free from pollution" is alone, "has passed the path without fork
in the road" is alone, "has attained enlightenment, supreme
enlightenment" For being alone.
　　How is the Enlightened One who is alone in the name of being a monk?
"After the Enlightened One has cut off all obstacles in the home, after
cutting off the obstacles of children and wives, after cutting off the
obstacles of relatives" After cutting off the obstacles of friends],
after cutting off the obstacles of storage, after shaving the hair and
beard, after wrapping in the robe, after becoming a homeless person from
home, entering a state of nothingness, walking, living, moving, turning
around, To protect, to survive, to survive.” This is the one who is
alone in the name of being ordained.
　　What is the one who is alone in the righteousness of being without a
partner? Forest and Biandi residences (reclining places): quiet, quiet,
away from the atmosphere of people, living alone, suitable for sitting
alone; he [walks alone,] walks alone, stands alone, sits alone, and sits
alone Lying alone, entering the village for alms, advancing alone,
returning alone, sitting alone in a quiet place, walking alone, walking
alone, dwelling, moving, turning up, guarding, perpetuating, and
living.” This is the one who is independent. The enlightened one is
alone without a partner.
　　How is the single enlightened one who renounces the righteousness of
craving as being alone? He is so alone and without a partner, when he
lives in the indomitable, enthusiastic, self-effort, great diligence,
diligent, after destroying the demons accompanied by the army, the evil
demons, the relatives of the loose, the nets, the strong flow, The
entangled craving he renounces, drives away, terminates, and brings it
to non-existence.
　　"A person who desires to be a partner has been in samsara for a long
time, and
　　　in this state and other states, he does not go beyond samsara.
　　　Knowing this fault: after craving is the origin of suffering
　　　, a bhikkhu should walk mindfully without craving and clinging. 』
[ It.15 <https://agama.buddhason.org/It/dm.php?keyword=15>/Sn.3.12,
745-746 verses]
　　Thus is the one who is enlightened alone who renounces the
righteousness of craving.
　　How could the solitary enlightened person take "always free from
greed" as his own? "Let one of the states of renunciation of greed go
toward liberation from greed" as independence, "with one of the states
of renunciation of hatred toward liberation from hatred" as
independence, "with one of the states of renunciation of delusion toward
liberation from delusion" as independence, "with one of the states of
renunciation of ignorance toward liberation from delusion", One of the
disconnected states is to be unpolluted" as alone. In this way, the
Solitary Enlightened One is "always free from greed" as his own.
　　What is it that the Enlightened One who "has passed the road without
fork in the road" is alone? The path of no fork in the road is called
the four mindfulness, the four righteous efforts, the four spiritual
feet, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of
enlightenment, and the eight noble paths.
　　"Those who see the extinction of life, those who have pity, know the
path without fork in the road,
　　　by which they crossed the storm before, and whatsoever they will
pass, and now pass through (to be and now). 』[ SN.47.18
<https://agama.buddhason.org/SN/sn.php?keyword=47.18>]
　　This is the one who has "passed the path without fork in the road"
as being alone.
　　How is the single enlightened one who "has been fully enlightened
alone, the supreme sole enlightened enlightenment" alone? Enlightenment
is called wisdom, wisdom, wisdom root, wisdom power, dharma
enlightenment factor, investigation, vipassana, and right view on the
four paths. The Enlightened One, the Enlightened One of Tao, and the
Enlightened One of Wisdom Enlightenment feel that "all actions are
impermanent"; "all actions are suffering"; "all dharmas are non-self";
"all dharmas are without self"; There are formations (and formations
exist) due to conditions; perception is that there is consciousness due
to action; consciousness is conditional, and there is mind and matter;
Feeling "touching is a condition and there is feeling"; feeling "feeling
is a condition and there is craving"; feeling "craving is a condition
and there is clinging"; Existence and existence; feel that "being is
conditioned and there is birth"; feel that "is conditioned to have old
age and death"; feel that "because ignorance is extinguished, there is
cessation of formation (and the cessation of formation exists)"; feel
"with the cessation of activity, there is consciousness" cessation of
consciousness; perception of the cessation of name and material
cessation by the cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six senses
with the cessation of name and materiality; cessation of touch with the
cessation of the six senses; cessation of sensation with the cessation
of contact; Feeling "with the cessation of craving, there is cessation
of craving"; with the cessation of craving, there is cessation; There is
old age and death"; feel "this is suffering"; feel "this is the
culmination of suffering"; feel "this is the cessation of suffering";
feel "this is the path leading to the path of suffering"; feel "these
are leakages"; feel "this is the cessation of suffering" The collection
of omissions... (abbreviated in the middle) I feel that "this is the
path leading to the omissions"; I feel that "these dharmas should be
universally known"; the sense "these dharmas should be discarded"; the
sense "these dharmas should be witnessed"; These dharmas should be
practised.”; Awareness of the rise, cessation, bliss, trouble, and
renunciation of the six points of contact; renunciation of the five
aggregates of clinging... (abbreviated in the middle); renunciation of
the four elements, Disappearance, pleasure, misfortune, renunciation; I
feel that "any kind of gathering is cessation".
　　Or, whatever [any] should be realized, should be realized, should be
awakened, should be enlightened, should be realized, should be touched,
should be attested, everything is determined by that alone. Awareness,
randomness, awakening, enlightenment, realization, touch, and testimony.
In this way, the single enlightened one who "has manifested the supreme
enlightenment alone" is alone.
