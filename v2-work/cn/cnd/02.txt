7. All the discerning ones, and all the learned and


　wise ones here, when I ask them how they behave, dear sir! Please
tell. [ SN.12.31 <https://agama.buddhason.org/SN/sn.php?keyword=12.31>]


"The comprehend of all things": The comprehend of dharma is called
an arahant, one who has exhausted all omissions. For what reason is a
Dhamma comprehend called an arahant, one who has exhausted all
defilements? They are those who perceive the law, those who know the
law, those who measure the law, those who judge the law, those who
understand the law, and those who understand the law. "All deeds are
impermanent." Those who perceive Dharma, who know Dharma, who measure
Dharma, who judge Dharma, who understand Dharma, who understands Dharma;
"All actions are suffering" who perceive Dharma. The one who realizes...
(Abbreviated in the middle) The one who realizes the Dharma of "all
actions are without self"... The one who realizes the Dharma that "acts
with ignorance as a condition"... The Dharma that "every collection of
Dharma is the Dharma of extinction" Those who know the law, those who
know the law, the one who measures the law, the one who judges the law,
the one who understands the law, and the one who understands the law.
Or, for them it is the discerner of aggregates, the discerner of worlds,
the discerner of places, the discerner of places of interest, the
discerner of rebirth, the discerner of rebirth, the discerner of some ,
the discerner of reincarnation, the discerner of reincarnation. Or, they
are those who end up in the aggregate (boundary), those who end up in
the world, those who end up in the place, those who end up in the place
of interest, those who end up in rebirths, those who end up in the end
The abbot who is born the ultimate, the one who has the ultimate, the
one who is the ultimate in reincarnation, the one who is the ultimate in
the reincarnation [, the one who is the ultimate one], the one who has
the last, the one who is in the ultimate The dweller who gathers (the
body) last, the Arahant who holds the last body.


"[In innumerable kalpas, they are those who have acquired bodies,]


　this is their last, last gathering (body),


　Reincarnation of life and death, without them there is again
(rebirth). "[Thag. 202]


For this reason the comprehension of Dhamma is called an arahant,
one whose defilements have been exhausted. "Those who perceive the
Dharma, and here all have learning": "'Those who learn', why are they
called learning? 'They learn' is learning. And what do they learn? They
also learn to improve the mind , and they also learn to improve the wisdom.


What is the increase of the morals? Here, the monks are the
precepts, who live underthe protection of the self-control of the
Paratimcha, who have the right conduct, Practicing circumstances, seeing
terrible things in all the petty sins, and learning after receiving and
upholding them in various learning areas. The small and major precepts
are the basis of precepts, the [self] restraint of behavior, the
entrance of self-control, the good dharma, etc. ( Achieving the first of
the above, this is the study of increasing the precepts.


What is the study of increasing the mind? Here, the bhikkhu from the
liberation of desire... (abbreviated in the middle) the first
jhana...the second jhana...the third jhana...After entering, he dwells
in [ The fourth jhāna, which is neither suffering nor pleasure, but
which is composed of tranquility and pure mindfulness
, is the learning of the advanced mind.

What is the learning of the
advanced wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a man of wisdom, who has the
ability to leadarising and passing away , holy, insight, leading to the
complete cessation of sufferingZhihui, he knew as it really was, "This
is suffering. '... (abbreviated in the middle) 'This is a set of
bitterness. '... 'This is the cessation of suffering. ' Knowing
truthfully 'this is the path leading to the path of suffering. '...
'These are leaks. 』…… 『This is a missing set. '... 'This is the
cessation of leakage. ' Knowing as it is: 'This is the path leading to
the stray path. ' This is Zeng Shang Hui Xue. These three things, they
learn when facing (notice); they learn when they know; they learn when
they see; they learn when they examine; they learn when the mind is
established (determination); they learn when they overcome with faith ;
they learn when vigor is striving; they learn when mindfulness arises;
they learn when mind is concentrated; they learn when they know with
wisdom; they learn when they are realized; they learn when they are
realized; They learn when they are known; they learn when they are
abandoned; they learn when they are practiced; they learn when they are
witnessed, they practice, they practice well, and after upholding They
turn. For this reason they are called educated. "Every" means many.
These learnings are Sudokan practitioners, Stoggam practitioners, Anagam
practitioners, and Arahants practitioners. "Here", in this view, in this
liking, in this liking, in this assertion, in this Dhamma, in this
precept, in this law, in this teaching, in this holy life , in the
teachings of this master, in this individual, in this human world.
"Because everyone here has learning.


"When the wise are asked by me about their conduct, dear sir! Please
tell": "You are the wise, the wise, the wise, the enlightened, the wise

synonymous with love language, honorific, respectful, submissive.' For
dear sir." For the wise when I ask about their behavior, dear sir!
Please tell.


Because of that, the Brahmin said,


"Those who perceive the dharma, and whoever learns here,


　Wise men are asked by me about their conduct, dear sir! Please tell.


8. You should not be greedy for desires, your mind should not be
turbid, you should be

These are called polluting desires. Covetousness is called craving,
which is greed, greed... (Middle omitted) greed, the root of greed.

greedy, should not be obstructed, should be free from cravings, have no
cravings, have given up cravings, have eliminated cravings, and have

greed, give up greed, get rid of greed, free from greed, give up greed,
give up thinking Those who are greedy, those who are not thirsty, those
who have been extinguished, those who have become cool, those who feel
happiness, should live in themselves as Brahman's already-born ones."

things becomes cloudy, churning, moving, bumping, fluctuating, swirling,
and restless. "The mind should be unclouded": "The mind should be
unclouded: not agitated, not passive, not bumped, not fluctuated, not
swirled, calmed, in cloudiness, in contamination He should give up, he
should abandon, he should drive away, he should end, he should make it
to non-existence. After leaving, having been liberated, and having been
freed from fetters, he should live with a mind free from restrictions."
The mind should not be cloudy.


"A skillful one of all dharmas": "'All actions are impermanent' is a
skillful one of all dharmas; 'All actions are suffering' is a skillful
one of all dharmas; A skillful person; "acting with ignorance as a
precondition" is a skillful person of all dharmas... (Abbreviated in the
middle) "Any collection of dharmas is a cessation of dharma" is a
skillful person of all dharmas, this is a skillful person of all dharmas.


Or, [viewed] as impermanent and skilled in all dharmas; suffering...
(abbreviated in the middle), disease... tumor... arrow... woe...
disease... yes On the other side... corrupt... calamity... scourge...
terror... scourge... mobile... fragile... weak... no shelter... ...is

dharmas.


Or, skillful of khandha, skillful of world, skillful of base,
skillful of dependent arising, skillful of mindfulness, skillful of
right diligence, skillful of spiritual feet, skillful of root, skillful
of power, skillful of enlightenment The skillful one of the factors, the
skillful one of the path, the skillful one of the fruit, and the
skillful one of Nirvana, are also the skillful one of all dharmas.


Or, all dharmas are called the twelve sense bases: eye and form, ear
and sound, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and touch, mind and
dharma, and because of desire, greed for the self, both inside and
outside of oneself Being discarded, the root has been cut off, [like] a
palm tree whose root has been cut off, becomes non-existent, something
that will not be born in the future, this situation is also the skillful
one of all dharmas. "To be a skilled person in all dharmas.


"Bhikkhus should walk with mindfulness": "mindfulness", there are
four ways to be mindful: when practising mindfulness on the body with
mindfulness of the body, when practising mindfulness on feelings Mindful
when contemplating feeling, mindful when practising mindfulness of mind,
mindful when mindful of dharmas, mindful of dharmas.


The next one is mindful in four ways: mindful in avoiding
non-thought, mindful in the state where the dharma that should be done
with mindfulness is done, mindful in the state where the dharma
obstructed by mindfulness is destroyed, The state of not forgetting the
Dharma of mindful factor (phase) is mindful.


The next one is mindful in four ways: mindful in the state of being
mindful, mindful in the state of being mindful, mindful in the state of
being proficient in mindfulness, mindful in the state where mindfulness

Buddha, who are mindful of the Dharma, who are mindful of the Sangha,
who are mindful of the precepts, The mindful of giving alms, the
mindfulness of heaven; the mindfulness of breathing in and out, the
mindfulness of death, the mindfulness of the body, the mindfulness of
silence ; All thoughts, random thoughts... (abbreviated in the middle)
mindfulness, the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, the path without
fork in the road, this is called mindfulness. To have, to have, to
reach, to reach, to have, to have, to have this thought, he is called
thoughtful. "Bhikkhu", the state of destruction of the seven dharmas is
a bhikkhu: the destruction of body view, the destruction of doubt, the
destruction of precepts and prohibitions, the destruction of greed, the
destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion, the destruction of
laziness, the destruction of those evil and unwholesome dharmas : Go
along with the pollution, the reoccurrence, the fear, the bitter
retribution, and the life, old age and death in the future.


[World-Honored One: "Sebiya!"] [Sn.3.6, 519 verses]


"By the path that one has practiced (working), one has reached
parinibbana, surpassed those who doubt, and after abandoning


　non-being and being, those who have completed it, If there is one
who has already perished, he is a monk."


"Bhikkhus should walk mindfully": "A monk should walk mindfully, he
should walk mindfully, he should stand mindfully, he should sit
mindfully, and he should mindfully walk. Lying down, you should move
forward mindfully, you should step back mindfully, you should look
forward mindfully, you should observe mindfully, you should bend
mindfully, you should straighten mindfully, you should hold your coat
mindfully, Bowls and clothes should walk, stay, move, turn around,
guard, keep alive, and survive.” For bhikkhus, they should walk
consciously.


Because of that, the Blessed One said,


"There should be no craving for lust, the mind should be unclouded,


　Being skilled in all dharmas, bhikkhus should walk mindfully. At
the same time as


the verse ends, those who dwell in the same will, the same effort,
the same intention, and the same abode as theBrahman , those thousands
of living beings who are far away from the dust, the dharma eye that is
free from defilements arise: "Any collection of dharmas is a cessation
of dharmas." The Brahman's mind was freed from the defilements attached
to it. Upon reaching the realm of an arahant, the sheepskin robe, hair
knot, bark robe, staff, long-mouthed water bottle, hair and beard are
removed, and those who become bald-headed, cassock-clothed, bearers of
overcoats, bowls, and robes fold their hands together in the manner of
their meaning. Respecting the World-Honored One, he sat down and said,
"Great virtue! The World-Honored One is my teacher, and I am my disciple."


The first explanation asked by the Brahmin, the student of Ayito,
was [completed].


Notes:
　1. Protecting with mindfulness, closing all streams with wisdom
(seeing impermanence, suffering, not-self, dependent arising).
　2. The place where consciousness ceases (Ni. 21, 30), the name (four
immaterial aggregates <https://agama.buddhason.org/Ni/Ni21.htm>), and
the form are destroyed.
　3. The comprehension of the Dharma is not greedy in desires, has
thoughts, and does not have cloudy minds (Zangheng, jealousy, deceit,
and deceit...).
