Notes:
　1. Based on the determination of the place of nothingness ( Ni.31
<https://agama.buddhason.org/Ni/Ni31.htm>), the realization of
liberation: there is no dependence (consciousness does not allow it to
exist), and it is impermanent suffering in terms of the arising mental
state...(= Vipassana = Wisdom), freed from doubt, rising day and night
to see the cessation of craving through the storm.
　2. The liberated person is like a flame thrown by the wind, and it
does not come to the title until it is extinguished. For him, the
measure does not exist, because when all the dharmas have been
eradicated, all the ways of speech are also eradicated.
