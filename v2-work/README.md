# v2 stuff

The files in this directory are Google translations from two versions of the
Thai Tipitaka, and a retranslation from the same Chinese source. Sources for
those have been added to the book's introduction already. Basically I'm
repeating the v1 process, but this time basing it on v1 itself, and
incorporating corrections from the auto-translated stuff from Thai.

## TODO

* Go back through, line by line, comparing against each of these new versions
* Add line/verse numbers back in, maybe? (See note in introduction)
* Fill in `omitted, see previous` bits
* Update zacanger.github.io/sitemap.sh when done
