Knowing karma is the cause of ignorance. \[485\] The word euphoria is
complemented by this: Desire in form says that pleasure is
complementary. to know that karma that is attached to, entangled by
imperative desire, that is, to know, to know, to compare, to consider,
to clarify, to make manifest is related as a binding device It\'s a
worry machine. The word Iti is a chapter. Etc. The word Iti follows the
order of the chapters. therefore

Therefore, it is called having pleasure as a constituent as follows.
Knowing is knowing, comparing, contemplating, clarification, and making
manifestation of that karma in this way. This job already. \[487\] The
word, in that order, contemplates (dharma) in that realm, that he enters
the enlightenment, spawns and leaves that state. and then contemplate,
that is, to see, to examine, to look at, to contemplate, to contemplate
all the dharmas, that is, the mind and the cetasikas that arise in that
samadhi by being impermanent, suffering, diseased, etc., without any
trickery. Therefore it is called that, in that order, contemplates
(dharma) in that existence. \[488\] That person\'s true insight, that
is, that person\'s true, true, non-violent insight, therefore, is called
that. It is the true intellect of that person. \[489\] The word
\"brahman\" in Uthes, \"Brahmanssa Wusimato\" means that the name is
Brahman because it floats. The seven dharmas have already existed. Etc.
A person who is no longer dependent on craving and view is a stable
person, he is said to be a Brahmin. Therefore, he is called a brahmin.
The word \"lives the end of the virtuous life\" means that seven
peoples, including the ladies-in-arms, live. gathered all around to
reach the dharma that had not yet been reached to attain the dharma that
has not yet been attained; to make it clear which the dharma that has
not yet been made known You finished and finished the business. The
burden has been relieved There is a benefit that has already been
reached, respectively. freed from defilements by right knowledge. An
Arahant is endowed with the Dhamma, has a well-behaved conduct, etc.,
does not have pity, that is, birth, aging and Death does not exist any
longer, therefore it is called He is a brahmin, the end of the holy
life. Because of that The Blessed One said that that person knew karma
as the cause of the birth in the realm of life. having pleasure is the
constituent of this, having known that karma in this way, he then
contemplates (dharma) in that state. which is a brahmin At the end of
the virginity. with the end of the spell, etc. The Blessed One is my
teacher. I am a disciple, therefore, I have finished the 14th
Posalmanava Problematic Nidthes. ------------- Mokharajmanavakhana
Nittas Regarding the problems of Than Mokharat \[490\] (Phra Mokharat
asked) I have inquired twice already.

The Blessed One who had no eyes had predicted me. I- He heard that For
the third time, the Blessed One was a hermit (they asked questions) for
the third time, he prophesied. \[491\] The word \"I am Sakka\" I have
asked this question twice, saying that the Brahmin has asked the
question of the Enlightened One. That time, the Blessed One asked the
question, not predicting in the order of the eyes. The organic maturity
of this brahmin will be there. The Blessed One is called Sakka.
Sakyasakul, even for the following reasons: hence his name is Sakka. The
Blessed One is wealthy and possesses a lot of wealth even because of the
following reasons. His name is Sakka. This is wealth is faith. Property
is morality, hiritha. y is ottappapap is sutapapap is suta is sap is sap
is wisdom Property is the foundation of mindfulness Property is the
assumption Property is power Property is organic, property is health,
property is Bojjong. Property is the path, property is the result,
property is nirvana. The Blessed One is very wealthy, possessing many
wealth. Even for this reason, he was called Sakka. The Blessed One is a
valiant, valiant, capable, capable, valiant, advanced, non-cowardly
person. not terrified, one who does not flinch, one who does not flee,
has given up fear of cowardice, is free from furrows. even because of
the following reasons therefore named Sakka, therefore called \"Sakka\",
I \... 2 times already. The Buddha image I have inquired, asked, asked,
invited, and asked him twice, therefore it is called I, Lord, I have
inquired twice. The word Iti in the context of Ijjasma, Mogharaja is a
junction, etc. The word Aysma is a saying of love. The word Mogharaja is
the name and the invocation of that brahmin, therefore it is called
Mogharaja. \[492\] The word did not prophesy to me in the word na me
pyakasi jakkuma, meaning not to say \... not to I announced to me. The
word \"Eye\" means that the Blessed One has five eyesights, namely,
human-eye-eyes, Dhipaya-sight, Wisdom-sight, Buddha-eyes-eyes,
Samanta-eyes. How does a Buddha have eyes even with a Buddhist eye? The
five colors are green, yellow, red, black and white. appear to the
Blessed One in the eyes of the Buddha. His eyes are located only in a
place where there is a green, green, attractive, attractive, like the
color of water hyacinths. The next one is yellow. yellow is good The
golden color of Kanna looks attractive like a yellow Kanika flower. Eye
sockets on both sides. The Blessed One\'s color is red, red, attractive,
attractive, like the color of the wings of a ruby-gold insect. in the
middle

It is black, good black, not tarnished, completely black, attractive and
attractive, like the color of fire brick. Next to that, there is white,
good white, pure white, pure white, nice to look at, nice to look at,
like the color of a star with a dazzling flora. The Blessed One has a
monk- because of the image caused by honest karma in the past life, he
sees it all around Both day and night. even when there is darkness It
consists of four elements: the sun has set, the night of the waning
temple, the dense forest line, the great cloud rises, and the darkness
consists of Seeing the Fourth Form like this, at that time the Blessed
One and he saw all the people around him. Holes, gates, walls,
mountains, stumps, or vines are nothing to prevent him from seeing
images. If a person should take One sesame seed is a mark. put it into a
wagon for loading sesame. That person should take that sesame seed. Such
is the nature of the eyes of the Blessed One. The Blessed One also has
eyes. Vegetarians like this. How does the Blessed One have an eye even
with a divine eye? The Blessed One considers saw the beasts that were
incarnating by the divine eye of mankind, through the pure eye of
mankind, he is thus able to know clearly which of the beings are
subjected to karma. The Blessed One wants to see the world, one good,
two good, three good, four good, five good ten, good twenty, good
thirty, good forty, good fifty, good hundred, one thousand and one. A
small amount of work is good. Two thousand is a moderate part, three
thousand is a good thing, and four thousand is a great part, or how much
he wishes to see the world of elements? He saw only the elemental world.
This is the Divine Eye of the Blessed One. The Blessed One has an eye
even with such a vision. How does the Blessed One have eyes even with
wisdom? The Blessed One has great wisdom. have broad wisdom He is
enlightened, has wisdom, has wisdom, is sharp, has wisdom, destroys
desires, is wise in the category of wisdom. have a broken mind He had
attained the oath, had reached the 4th Vesarachayanana, had the power of

well-mannered man. He was a man running errands. having infinite

lot of wealth, being considered as having wealth, being a leader
Congratulations. that has not yet arisen, has led the people to
understand the path that has not yet been understood He has told the way
that no one has told, knows the way, knows the way, is wise in the way.
That\'s it for now. The disciples were the ones who followed the path
that followed later. The Blessed One is known, known, is seen, is seen,
is wise, wise, dharma, and has noble qualities. a person who preachs the
dharma general speaking His Highness gave advice on the benefits of
giving immortality. The Dharma Husband went like that. He did not know

all dharmas. due to skepticism Because of the blessing, because of the
enlightened mind of the Blessed One. The insight of the Enlightened One
is possible in all beings. The Blessed One Knowing as the place where
all beings lie down He clearly knew the animals who has only passion The

an archer shoots sand feathers accurately. Those sages are as though
rambling with their own wisdom to destroy views. Those graduates The
problem has come to see the Tathagata. Ask those questions. The Blessed
One has spoken and corrected, and has shown cause and cited results.
Those graduates are great. in line with the Buddha image, in order

Then the Blessed One ascended with wisdom in that place. because of that
The Blessed One is therefore called There is an eye even with this kind
of wisdom. How does the Blessed One have eyes even with the eyes of the
Buddha? The Blessed One, upon examining the world with the Buddha\'s
eye, saw in his eyes a sage with lust like dust. Few who have only
passion as the dust in the eye is great wisdom. Those with old and weak
organics, those with older organics, those with good symptoms, and those
with bad symptoms. The mentor is easy to know. It\'s difficult for a
mentor to know. Some of them are normal people who see the dangers and
dangers in the Hereafter. In the Ubon, in the Kopathum or in the Kobon,
the Ubon Bua, the green lotus, the Pathum Bua Luang, or the lotus
flower, the white lotus, some species are born in the water, grow in the
water, go along the water, submerge in the water that nurtures them.
Some species are born in the water, grow in the water, always stand in
the water. Some species are born in water, grow in water, emerge from
the water. Even as the water was nurtured, the Blessed One examined it.
Lok with the eye of the Buddha He saw a group of stupa who has only
passion Like the dust in the eye is little wisdom. who has only passion
The dust in the eye is great wisdom. organically grown person Those who
have organic powers, those with good symptoms, and those with bad
symptoms, who are easy to advise. It is difficult for the mentor to
know. Some people normally see the dangers and dangers in the Hereafter.
I\'m the same. The Blessed One knows that this person is sensual. This
person is a bad person. This person is dishonest. This person is wicked,
this person is wicked. This person is insidious. The Blessed One gave a
speech to a person who was ignorant. Saying mercy and praying to a
person who is enraged. His Highness advised the deceitful person to
settle in because of the content and the interrogation in listening to
the Dharma in the Dharma conversation in coexistence with the teacher.

people around him should be seen, O Venerable Sumedha, he ascended to
the sanctuary with dharma. without sorrow He saw the people who were
enraged in sorrow. People who are born and old dominate, like that. The
Blessed One has eyes even with this eye. How does the Blessed One have
eyes even with the Samatha? Sampanya, he said that Samantachakhu.
Reaching, reaching, ready, consisting of omniscience. There is not any
dharma that the Blessed One does not see, does not know, or does not
know. He knows only all the Dharma chapters. Whatever chapter exists,
the Exalted One knows that chapter. Therefore, the Tathagata

Therefore, he is a monk. The Blessed One has an eye even with such an
eye. Therefore, it is called the Blessed One who has eyes. He did not
prophesy to me. \[493\] I heard that the Blessed One who is a hermit
(When someone asks a question) for the third time, he predicted as
follows: that I have studied, memorized, and determined. Then like this
The Buddha who asked the question For the third time, he prophesied and
did not forbid it. The word \"Phra Thep Hermit\" means that the Lord He
is both a deity and a hermit, therefore it is called a hermit. Just as
the king was ordained, he was called a brahmin, ordained a brahmin, and
then called a brahmin hermit. Both are hermits, and so are they.
Therefore, they are called hermits. one more thing The Blessed One has
become ordained, even for this reason, he is called a hermit. Even for
this reason So he was called a hermit. The Blessed One seeks, seeks,
seeks, finds the great samadhi. Great wisdom Wimuttikhan Yai

Where did the devas dwell? Where does the Blessed One, more valiant than
the people live, even for the following reasons? Therefore, he was
called a hermit. I have heard that the Blessed One who is a hermit
(Someone asked questions) for the third time, the King made a
prediction. because of that Then the brahmin said I am a monk I have
inquired twice. The Blessed One has not prophesied to me. I heard that

this is the human world. The other world is the whole world. Take this
world of mankind as another world, hence the name. This world, another

\[500\] The word enlightened This means that the one who sees the

sees the dharma very much, therefore he is called one who sees such a
beautiful dharma. \[501\] Words that I have a need So we came to watch

to give explanations, to speak, even because of this reason: therefore,
I am in need. Problems therefore come to watch. \[502\] The word, how to
see the world, means that the seer sees, considers, compares, prosper,
makes it clear. Therefore, it is called how to see the world? \[503\]
The word \'death\' does not see it as neither sees nor experiences, does
not meet, does not specifically, therefore it is called \'death\'. see.
Therefore, the brahmin said that I had a need with a problem. therefore
came to watch over the Lord See this beautiful Dharma. when a person
considers the world So the mortal did not see it. \[504\] Lord Mokharaj,
you must be mindful and see the world with your mind.

this tactic. When a person sees the world like this So the mortal did
not see it. \[505\] The word world in the upheath is suto lok
avekkhassu, as follows: Nirayalok, Tiratchanan, Pittivisaya, human
beings, Deva world, Khanthalok, Elemental, Ayana, this world, other
worlds. The Brahma world with all the gods. One of the monks asked the
Blessed One: Blessed One The Blessed One said that the world, the world,
like this: He said, for what reason, the world? The Blessed One replied,
"Bhikkhus, I say that the world because of its collapse. What is
different? Broken eye, broken shape, broken spirit eye. Eye contact is
broken, feeling is good, suffering is good. All bitterness and suffering
are good. that occurs because the eye is a factor Even the pain was
broken. Broken ears, broken voices, broken noses, broken smells, broken
tongues, broken tastes, broken bodies, broken eyes, broken spirits,
broken spirits, broken consciousness, broken feelings, happiness and
pain. All bitterness and suffering are good. that occurs because the
mind is a factor Even the pain was broken. Bhikkhus, the Dharma is such
a monk. will be broken as follows Therefore we say the world. The term
contemplates the world as a matter of possession means that one sees the
world as Being is lost for two reasons: one is able to determine that it
is not possible and one is able to consider sankhara as a Empty 1. A
person considers the world as a waste with the ability to determine that
it is not possible in power. What? No one can gain power in form, in
feeling, in covenant, in body, in spirit. Indeed, according to the
Buddha\'s words, monks, Rapu is anatta. monks If this image would be an
ego, then This image should not lead to anger. and it will be obtained
in the form: Let my form be like this. Our image should not be like this
at all. But, bhikkhus, because form is selfless, therefore form leads to
affliction. and not in the form that Let our form be like this, let our
form not be like this. Feeling is selfless. Monks, if this feeling would
be self, then This feeling should not lead to anger. and be satisfied
that have our pity Let it be like this, our pity should not be like
this. See monks. But because feeling is non-self, therefore feeling
leads to affliction. and it is not in the sense that May our pity be
like this, may our pity be like this. The contract is soulless. look at
the monks If this contract is to be Ego This contract should not lead to
anger. and as promised in the contract that ask for our promise So
let\'s be this, our promises can\'t be like this. See monks. But because
the contract is selfless, therefore the contract is for enmity. and not
in the contract that May our promises be like this, our promises never
be like this. The body is anatta. look at the monks If this sankhara
would be

Ego This sankhara should not lead to affliction. and will receive in the
body that ask for our body Let\'s be like this, my body must not be like
this. Look at the monks. Because sankhara is anatta, therefore sankhara
leads to affliction. and can\'t be in the body that Let our bodies be
like this, let our bodies not be like this at all. The soul is soulless.
Bhikkhus, if this consciousness were to be self, then This spirit should
not lead to affliction. and it will be obtained in the spirit, saying,
May my spirit be like this, my spirit not be like this. The soul is
selfless, therefore the soul is subject to affliction. And it is not in
the spirit that let our spirit be like this. Our spirits should not be
like this at all. This body, bhikkhus, is neither yours nor that of
others. All these old kamma that has been modified The intention is to
be the cause. You should see it as the place of suffering. Bhikkhus, in
that body the noble disciple It is extinguished and it is well respected
to the supreme supremacy that is because of the following: when
something exists, this exists; because this arises. this happened When
this does not This does not exist. Because this is extinguished, this is
extinguished, that is, because ignorance is a factor, there is body.
Because body is a factor, there is spirit; because spirit is a factor,
there is a name. Because the name-form is the factor, there is salaat,
because the salaytana is the condition, there is contact, because the
contact is the condition, there is feeling. Because feeling is a factor,
there is craving; because craving is a factor, there is clinging.
Because prejudice is a factor, there is a world. Because existence is a
factor, there is birth; because birth is a factor, there is old age,
death, soka, parideva, suffering, sorrow, and upays. occurrence of The
whole mass of suffering is like this: because ignorance ceases without
vomit, sankhara is extinguished, because body is extinguished,
consciousness is extinguished, because consciousness is extinguished by
name and form. extinguish Because his name and form are fading away\*,
Thana is extinguished; because of his death, his contact is
extinguished. because of the touch of feeling, the feeling is
extinguished Because of feeling, craving is extinguished, because of
craving is extinguished, clinging is extinguished. Due to the cessation
of existence, suffering is extinguished, because of existence, birth,
aging, death, soka, parideva, suffering, sorrow and upayas are
extinguished. The cessation of all suffering is good. with symptoms like
this. The world by belonging and extinction is capable of defining. that

with the ability to consider For these two reasons, one sees the body as
an emptiness. A small person sees the world as being, being lost by six

that point? Any grass, trees, branches and leaves that exist in this
Jetavana vihara shall be taken away by the grass, trees, branches and

the people led us to waste and burned. Or did he act as he should for
some cause? Well, the monks said that it was not so, my Lord Buddha. For
what reason? Because those things are not myself or things related to
myself, then, my Lord Buddha. look at the monks me too What is not yours
All of you, leave that thing aside. that which you have abandoned as for

Venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One: Blessed One He said that the
world is lost as follows. He said, For how much is the world lost? The
Blessed One replied, \"Look, Ananda, because of the loss of oneself or
from something that is related to oneself, therefore, it is said that
the world is lost. Look, Ananda, what is lost from oneself? or from
things that depend on them? The eye is lost, the form is lost, the
spirit is lost. Eye-contact is lost, pleasure-feeling is good,
pain-feeling is good, feeling is bad-feeling, feeling* is good because
eye-contact is a factor. even if that pain is lost from oneself or
something that is related to them. The ear is lost, the voice is lost,
the nose is smelled, the tongue is lost, the taste is lost, the body is
lost, the touch is lost, the mind is lost, the mind is lost, the mind is
lost, the mind is lost, the feeling is lost, the pain is gone, the
feeling is gone, touch is a factor Even if that feeling is lost from
oneself or from things which are related to oneself, see Ananda, because
of one\'s loss or from that which one has to do with oneself, therefore
it is said that the world is lost. Contemplate the world in such a state
of extinction. Behold, when one sees the emergence of all dharmas, which
is the continuation of all sankharas. in fact There is no such danger.
Whenever a person always considers the world grass and wood with wisdom,
then that person is undesirable. any other existence or existence,
except for the non-existent world.

In spite of this, a person sees the world as an extinction. and
realistic according to the Buddha\'s words, the Blessed One said:
Bhikkhus, the monk follows, searching for forms. How many mottos of form
are there? According to the search for compassion. How many thoughts of
feeling are there? Search for a contract. How many mottos of the
contract are there? According to the search for the body. How does the
mind of sankhara exist? Searching for the spirit. How many spirit mottos
are there? It\'s like that. When a bhikkhu searches for form, how many
mottos of form are there? in search of pity How much is the motto of
feeling? According to the search for contracts, how many mottos of the
contract are there? Searching for the body How many thoughts of sankhara
exist? According to the spirit search, how many spirit mottos are there?
No matter what power we hold, we are good, our desire is good, we are
good, monks. which exists Even so, there is no such thing as regard to a
monk. A small person sees the world in such a state of extinction. The
word \"consider the world as a possession\" means \"look, contemplate,
compare, examine, make it clear. make it appear which the world by its
belonging is lost, therefore it is called, consider the world by its
belonging and its extinction. \[506\] The Blessed One called that
Brahman by the name Mokharat, in the Udeh as Mokharat Satha Sto, as
follows. At a later age. The word mindful means having mindfulness for
four reasons, namely, mindfulness and the development of mindfulness.
Contemplating the body in the body, etc., that person is said to be

suspicion Just as the Buddha lies down without any suspicion. look at
the monks forest area travel in the big forest walk without disgust
Standing without disgust Free from loathing. For what reason? look at
the monks For as the flesh does not go in the way of a hunter. Bhikkhus,
monks, a monk is secluded from the seclusion of the unwholesome Dharma.
Thamajhana is anxious and reflective, has joy and Happiness arises from
solitude. Here, monks, I say: made the devil blind He has gone to a
place where the devil can\'t see the shark. one more thing monks
attaining second meditation which is transparent of the inner mind,
which is dharma, the singularity arises, there is no worry, no judgment,
because the worry has gone away. There was only joy and happiness born

all respects. wa achieves the concept of na-sanya-jhana by virtue of
saying: This is calm, this is refined Taniroth is here. and all her

could not see. A bhikkhu has crossed over the desires that are involved
in the world and becomes a man. As from suspicion walks. Without
suspicion, danger stands, without suspicion sits. Free from suspicion

factors are available, dominate all dangers. no fear One should wander

\"considerably comfortable in the four directions\" is jatuddiso
appatikoca hoti, thus: The Buddha\'s mind is full of mercy, spreading in
one direction, the second direction, the third direction, and the fourth
direction. In this sense, both above and below. On the other hand, there

the burrows of aquatic animals The beasts that live in the forest tree
dwelling as in the tree So so are those filthy unwholesome dhammas that
arise from the self and arise in the self. dangerous name because of the
view that all unwholesome qualities reside in This kind of selfishness.
realistically according to the Buddha\'s words, the Buddha said: look at
the monks Bhikkhus who are familiar with the defilements of the
antiquity Those who live with the passion of being a teacher would live
in sorrow and not happiness. Look, bhikkhus, the inspecting monks with
the passion that is anthevasik How to live in misery and not well?
Bhikkhus, by seeing a form with the unwholesome eye, any filthy dharmas
initiated in remembrance of the bountiful bounties arise upon a bhikkhu
in this religion Those filthy unwholesome dharmas linger, disappearing
within the mind of that monk. for this reason That monk, therefore, I
said, \'The explorer and the defilements are undevasik. Those obscene
unwholesome qualities govern a monk for the following reasons:
Therefore, that monk, we say that the explorer is the master\'s passion.
one more thing because listening to the sound with the ears because of
sniffing with the nose because of the taste with the tongue because it
is right to touch with the body because he knows the Dharma by heart Any
obscene unwholesome dharma that is done with utmost reverence The
blessings that are accrued to the bhikkhus, those filthy unwholesome
qualities linger and perish within that monk\'s mind. for this reason
That monk, therefore, said that the

together with the passion that is anthevasik. Those lewds rule over the
monks because of that, therefore we say that the bhikkhu is a master of
defilements. Behold, monks, the monks, who are in the study of the
defilements of the devasika, who live with the defilements of the
teacher, live as Suffering is not very enjoyable. It\'s called
dangerous. For it seems that all unwholesome dhammas reside in that
existence even this way. and realistic according to the Buddha\'s words,
the Buddha said: Monks, these three things are unclean between Piri
during hostile during was killed during Be an enemy in between. What are
the three things? look at the monks Greed is unclean during greed,
during enmity, during slaughter, during to be an enemy between the
monks, anger, etc. rulers are unclean during Blessed in between, enemy
in between, enemy in between. Monks, these three things are unclean
between Piri during hostile during was killed during Be an enemy in
between. Greed leads to harm that is not beneficial; greed leads to
relapse; danger arises within the mind. A bully is unaware of that
danger. A greedy person does not know its meaning. Greedy people do not
see Dharma. Greed reigns over the people at any moment, low darkness
exists at that moment. wrath also blame It is not beneficial to cause.
The anger caused the mind to start. disaster in the mind The bully did
not feel the danger. Angry people do not understand the meaning. Angry
people do not see Dharma. At what moment did anger dominate the people?
There was a great darkness at that moment. Moha still brings harm to the
mind. Moha still revives the mind. Danger arises within the mind. The
bully did not feel the danger. The delusional person does not understand
the meaning. The deceitful person does not see the Dharma. At what
moment does ignorance dominate the people? Darkness was low at that
moment. It was called danger because of the goodness that all
unwholesome dhammas resided in such a state. And realistically according
to the Buddha\'s words, the Blessed One said that, look at the dharma
that does three dangers when it arises within. It arises for the sake of
benefit, for suffering, for well-being. What are the three dangerous
dharmas? Look at Krommaphaphit, the Dharma that does harm is greed, and
when it arises within It happens to be of no benefit. Support for
suffering, for dissatisfaction. The act of harm is anger, etc. Look at
the Department of the Dharma up in the interior Not for benefit, for
suffering, for well-being. Look at Krom Maha Phit, these three dangerous
dharmas, when they arise within It arises for the sake of benefit, for
suffering, for well-being. Lobha, dosa, and moha arise in one\'s self,
oppressing men.

He who has a lewd mind, like his own lint, encroaches on bamboo.
Therefore, it is called dangerous because of the appearance of all
unwholesome dhammas. living in that state even like this. And
realistically, according to the Buddha\'s words, lust, hatred, delusion,
displeasure, delight, and eerieness are the reasons for this. Born from
this ego, the thought in the mind from this ego binds animals like
children to crows. Therefore, it is called danger. because all
unwholesome qualities reside in such a state. All dangers are therefore
called dominance. All dangers. The word \"one without fear\" means that
the Paccekasaka Buddha is neither cowardly, nor fearful. He did not
escape, having given up fear of cowardice and without fear of fear. His
hair was puffed up, hence the name of the ruler. All dangers have no
fear to travel. Go alone like a rhinoceros horn. The Paccekasum Buddha
said that There is normal, comfortable in the four directions, without
any resentment, can be pleased with the following conditions. dangerous
possession They do not have the fear of wandering alone like a
rhinoceros horn, therefore. It\'s hard to tell. A person should be a
person with little enthusiasm in Others and children should travel alone
So sleep on the rhino. \[694\] The saying that even a group of monks

not obey his words, acts rudely. Turned away by other symptoms,
therefore it is called that even a group of monks \... are hard to help

households in this world When someone else gives an elephant, a car, a
farm, a land, a money, a gold, a house, a city, a country, or not.

does not follow his words, is behaving rudely. is turned away by other
signs, therefore the name is, and the laymen, the vice-presidents.
\[696\] All have exalted themselves. He said in this comment that should
be a person with little enthusiasm in others and their children.

The word should be one who has little enthusiasm among the people. All
children and children say that one should be a person with little zeal,
that is, one who does not care. should be carefree, therefore, should be
called one who has little enthusiasm among others, and children should
travel alone to So the horn of a rhinoceros. Therefore, the Paccekasum
Buddha said that even a group of monks and householders who are hard on
others, one should be less anxious in Others and children should travel
alone So sleep on the rhino. \[697\] Heroic Paccekasum Buddha The mark

that the mark of the householder in the country Vaoropayat wagihiphiya

householder is that it has been laid down and abandoned; therefore, it
is called broken down. The mark of the householder. \[699\] The word,
like a golden tree with fallen leaves, means that the Paccekasum Buddha
cut off the layman\'s mark. shh Like the Thong Lang tree with its yellow
leaves already fallen, therefore it is called like the Tong Lang tree.
It has already fallen. \[700\] Phra Paccekasam Buddha is named as a

qualities of sensuality. Monks, what happiness arises through these five
sensual qualities, this happiness, I say, is sensual pleasure, it is the
bliss of excrement. the happiness of the common people It\'s not the
happiness of the Holy Spirit, it shouldn\'t be consumed, it shouldn\'t

people, when their body is corrupted, their speech is corrupted, their
mind is broken, and when their bodies are broken, they die. can reach
the vices of hell. Look at the monks. Many of the penalties of
sensuality, though, are present in the universe, as a heap of suffering,
with sensuality as the cause. There is eroticism as a fairy tale having
eroticism It is the cause of all sensual pleasures. The word seeing the
blame in your sensual pleasures means seeing, comparing, contemplating,
making it apparent. which is blamed on sensual pleasures, therefore it
is called seeing blame on sensual pleasures. One should travel alone
like the horn of a rhinoceros. Therefore, the individual Buddha said:
Well, all sensual pleasures are delightful, pleasing to the mind,
suffocating the mind with all kinds of emotions. One who sees the blame
in sensual pleasures, one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. An
arrow is a danger. A person sees this danger. in your sensual pleasures
One should wander alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. \[727\] Know in
the judgment that all sensual pleasures are stings, abscesses,
sinisters, sicknesses, sons. The arrow is a danger as follows: Bhikkhus,
the word is perilous, distressing, diseased, as an abscess, as an
affliction, as an animal, as a bosom, as a pregnancy. All of them are
the names of sensual pleasures. look at the monks So why is the word
\"dangerous\" the name of sensuality? Look, monks. This beast is
lustful. which I am grateful to be bound is not escaped from danger even
if there is, at present is not escaped from danger even in modern times
the end of the world, therefore this word of danger It is the name of
the erotic. look at the monks Why is it that the word suffering is a
disease, it is like an abscess?

Relationships are animals, they are stubble, they are pregnant, hence
the name of eroticism? Monks, this being is lustful. which I am grateful
to be bound It does not escape from the present, even if it is present.
Therefore, this word maternity is the name of sensuality. The human
beast had already sat down. Pleasant sensuality accompanies fetal
beings. Because of those sensual pleasures, the wise say, as peril, as
suffering, as a disease, as an abscess, as an affliction, Animals are
scum and are pregnant. Bhikkhus, whenever a bhikkhu does not abandon his
meditation, then that bhikkhu enters the sultry like a muddy road,
difficult to cross, he sees a multitude of living beings. like that
Reaching birth and old, struggling. Therefore, this word is called lust,
sting, scab, sting, sickness, arrow. \[728\] The word, seeing this
danger in all sensual pleasures, means seeing, comparing, considering,
clarifying, making it appear. which this danger in your sensual
pleasures Therefore it is called seeing this in your sensual pleasures.
One should wander alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. Therefore, the
Buddha said that this word of sensuality was stingy. An abscess is a
sinister, a disease, an arrow, a danger. The person sees this danger. in
your sensual pleasures One should wander alone like the horn of a
rhinoceros. \[729\] One who possesses all these dangers, namely cold,
heat, hunger, thirst, wind, sun, flies, and beasts, wander, and wander.
Just like the horn of a rhinoceros, therefore. \[730\] Coldness in
sitaca unha khudham pipasam, therefore, there are two reasons: coldness.
Chom Mee The ability of the elements within reappears 1 the great
coldness. with the ability of the outside seasons 1. The heat in the
word \"temperature\" can be for two reasons, namely, heat is also
capable of of the internal elements aggravated 1 the heat is good and
able of the seasons outside The dish says Pipasa. Therefore it is called
cold, heat, hunger, thirst. The sire spec is as follows: the east wind
The west wind, the north wind, the south wind, the wind with dust, the
cold wind, the hot wind, the weak wind, the raging wind, the raging
wind, the wind but the palm leaves, but the wind blows. Take the sun, he
said the sun. Yellow-eyed insects, he said that flies, snakes, he said
that tigers Therefore it is called wind, sun, flies, and crawling
beasts. \[732\] The word dominates in spite of all dangers means
possessing, suppressing, eliminating, overpowering.

Therefore, it is called dominating. In spite of all these dangers One
should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn, therefore. The Paccekasum
Buddha then said that One who possesses all these perils is cold, heat,
hunger, thirst, wind, sun, flies, and beasts, crawling, and wandering
alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. After all, the Lord Buddha, whose
khandha is born, has the Dhamma like the lotus flower, who is supremely
supreme in the forest. like the Naga, which all horde The khan was born
and ready. having a body like a lotus, a supreme person, living in the
forest, one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. Say va naga in
the words nako wa yuthani vijjayita as follows. Even the Paccekasum
Buddha is called a naga. The Paccekasam Buddha Why is it called Nak? The
Paccekasum Buddha is called a Naga. because he did not do evil, because
he did not arrive, because he did not come. The Paccekasum Buddha is
called a Naga. because of not doing evil, how? obscene morality causing
misery to be born in a new world to be *anxious and anxious It is the
place of aging and death. All the sacrifices and all the bindings has
been released He does not cling to all dharmas. He said that he was a
Naga, one who was stable and self-contained. The Paccekasum Buddha is
called a Naga. because he did not do such an evil deed. The Paccekasum
Buddha is called a Naga. Because it didn\'t arrive, how? Pacceka- the*

not for lust. not reached by anger not reached by rulers Not by power,
not by power not reach the power of appeal Not reached by vajikicha, not

it is not like this. Naga Why did you not come? The Pacceka- \*The
Buddha does not come again, does not come back, does not return to all
defilements that have been abandoned by the Sotapatti-fold. with the
skatakami mak with the future with the Arhatship. The Paccekasum Buddha
is called a Naga. because they didn\'t come like this. The word is like
the Naga with all the hordes, the noble elephant has abandoned, and the
horde are alone. to go in the middle of the forest, to travel, to walk,
to rest

as it is possible to heal, nourish, heal, go to the forest, I have
omitted that the village went alone as Rhino horns are living in a
quiet, secluded environment, with few sounds, no rumblings. Without the
wind but the people It is the negativity of human beings, worthy of
escaping. The Paccekasum Buddha walked alone, stood alone, sat alone,
slept alone, he went home for alms alone, returned alone, sat in a
secret place. Single Athit Thanjong Krom alone He is the only one who
travels, walks, changes his posture, rests, heals, maintains, heals.
Therefore, it is called like the Naga that all hordes of people have.
\[735\] The word khandha is already born. Just as a tusk of a lotus is

Sangha, Phra Maha Moggallana said, many we will show Avassut Scriptures
Sutra and Avassut Scriptures for all of you. Listen to the sermon, and
pay attention to it. We will say it. So the old man, as follows, said
Phra Maha Moggallana: Look at the elders Well, how is a bhikkhu a person
who is defilements? Elders, monks, who practice this Dharma and
Discipline Seeing a form with the eye, rejoices in a lovely figure;
rejoices in an unlovely figure. is a person who does not set up
physically and mentally There is little Dharma in mind, and that monk
does not know the reality of ceto-vimuti, wisdom-vimuti, which is famous
without rest of unwholesome qualities. The lewd thing that has already
arisen to you, listen to the sound with the sniffing wart with the
sinking. taste with finger Rightly touched by the body, knowing the
Dharma by the mind is good in the Dharma. love He is unlovable in
dharma, one who does not set his sights on body and mind. have a little
morality and that monk does not know the truth which cetovimuti, panya
wimuti, which is the utter extinction of the obscene unwholesome dharmas
that have already arisen to you. Elders, bhikkhus, say that one who is
enlightened in a form that should be known by the eye in the voice that
should be known by the ear, etc., in the Dharma that should be known by
the heart. Look at the elders A monk who lives like this, even if If the
devil comes in find that monk by ear, etc. If the devil comes to that
monk by mind The devil has a channel for a factor. Elders, it is like a
house made of reeds. or houses made of dry grass, rain shields can leak.
If a man takes a burning torch and enters that house in the east The
fire can get a hole. in the west, in the north, in the south Behind the
way above, even in any direction, the light can get a channel right now.
As you look at the elders

So so is a monk who lives like this. Likewise, if the devil comes to
that bhikkhu through the eyes of the devil, then if the devil comes to
that bhikkhu through his ears, etc. Even if the devil comes to that
bhikkhu through his mind, Mara gains the opportunity. In this way,
figure can dominate. A monk cannot control a monk. Voice can dominate a
monk. A monk cannot control a voice. Smell can overwhelm a monk, a monk
can\'t influence a monk, taste can overwhelm a monk. A monk cannot
control the taste. The dharma prevailed in the monks, the bhikkhus in
the dharma. These monks say that they are dominated by form, dominated
by sound. Dominated by smell, dominated by taste. being overwhelmed by
those lusts, those monks do not possess unwholesome qualities that make
them miserable. to be born in a new world to be anxious Suffering is the
place of aging and death. Let\'s continue to see old people who are
bhikkhus. Mr. L. Look, old people. How then is a bhikkhu a person who
has no desires? Elders, monks in this Dharma and Discipline I have seen
the picture with my eyes. Not happy with cute pictures. Do not be
displeased in unappealing forms. having a mind made up of immeasurable
dharmas and that monk knows clearly The reality which is ceto-vimuti,
wisdom, liberation, which is the cessation of the obscene unwholesome
states that have arisen, are heard by the ear, etc. I have already
informed the Dharma with my heart. does not rejoice in the lovely Dharma
Concentrate on physically and mentally having a mind made up of
immeasurable dharmas and that bhikkhu knows clearly as he is. Indeed,
Jetovimtu To you, the slain wisdom, which is the end of the obscene
unwholesome dharma that has already arisen. This bhikkhu said that he
was not enlightened, in a form that would be known by the eye, in a
sound that would be known. refrain from ear, etc. in the nature that
should be known by heart. Bhikkhus who live like this, if the devil
comes to that monk through the eyes of the devil, he doesn\'t have a
clue, if Even the devil came to that monk through the ears of the devil.
Can\'t make a reservation etc., if the devil comes to that monk The
devil\'s mind does not get the channel. factors. Look at the elders, it
is like a kutakan pavilion or a pavilion with thick soil and wet
plaster. Even if a man takes a torch that has been set on fire Going
into that house in the east, the fire was not able to pass through, even
if a man took a torch that was on fire. and then went into the spot of
that house on the west, on the north, on the south, on the back, on the
high Just as you, old people, monks who live like this, are likewise,
even if the devil comes to that monk through his eyes. The devil is not
a channel, not a factor. Even if the devil comes to that monk by ear,
even if the devil comes to that monk by heart The devil didn\'t get the
channel. Not a factor. For many monks, I normally pee like this, the
image does not dominate the monks. able to possess Voice cannot control
a monk; a monk can control a voice. Smell can\'t overwhelm a monk, a
monk can\'t control a smell, taste can\'t control a man, a monk can\'t
control a taste. The darts cannot dominate the monks. A monk can
dominate Dharma cannot dominate a monk. A monk can control the Dharma.
Look at you, old people. This bhikkhu said that the form, the sound, the
smell, the taste, the touch. Possessing Dharma. Those defilements cannot
dominate a monk. Monks possessing merit

obscene dharma that makes me miserable to be born in a new world Let
there be anxiety and suffering as the place of aging and death. Look,
old monks who are not passion It\'s already soaked. Therefore, he is
called the Elder. The passion is not wet anymore. The word fiery
defilements does not burn. It means that one who burns is passion, fire
is anger, fire is delusion, it does not burn, therefore it is called a
person who has no passion and is not ignorant of passion. Burning should
travel alone like a rhinoceros horn, therefore. Buddha He is the one who
has eyes that are downward, not illusory, because the feet protect the
organics. have a healed heart passion is not The passion fire does not
burn One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. Watered down, the
mark of a layman, holding a robe, stained with astringent water,
ordained Like a parichataka tree, it has dense leaves. One should wander
alone like a rhinoceros horn. \[777\] Hair and mustache, etc. The cloth
has a long man. He said that the mark of the householder in the country
is Ohar. Yitva gihipaychanani as follows. The word lay down is the mark
of the lay man; lay down is to abandon, suspend the mark of the lay man.
Therefore, it is named after the water. \[778\] The word is like a
parichataka tree with solid leaves. full alms and robes Like the
Parichhattaka, that is, the Thong Lang tree, it has thick leaves and
close shade, therefore it is called like the Parichattaka tree with
solid leaves. \[779\] The word to hold a cloth I was ordained, saying
that the Paccekasama Buddha cut off All secular concerns Worrying about
children and wives, worrying about relatives, worrying about wealth Hair
and mustache trimmed occupy the cloth ordained as a monk Access to being
a carefree person, being alone, going around, going around, taking care
of, maintaining and healing. Astringent water should be ordained to
travel alone So sleep on the rhino. Because of that Paccekasum Buddha
then said that Paccekasum Buddha Watered down, the mark of a layman,
holding a robe, stained with astringent water, ordained Like a
parichhattaka tree with thick leaves, one should travel alone So sleep
on the rhino. \[780\] Paccekasama Buddha Not enthralled in all tastes,
free of lusts that cause illusory, not enticing others, wandering
through alleys, having a mind that is not entangled in the family. One
should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. \[781\] The word in all
tastes is Rasesu Ketham, Akram, Aloelo, so this is the root flavor, the
root flavor, the root flavor. Bark, leaf flavor, flower flavor, fruit
flavor, sour taste, sweet taste, bitter taste.

Spicy taste, salty taste, pungent taste, tart taste, delicious taste.
Cool flavor, hot flavor. There are ascetics and brahmins who are
addicted to tastes in the world. those brahmins In search of taste with
the tip of the tongue, a sour taste is obtained. seeking a taste that is
not sour tastes not sour, then seeks sourness It tastes sweet seeks
unsweetened taste one acquires unsweetened, seeks sweet; finds bitter,
seeks uncompromising; seeks non-bitter, seeks bitter; gains spiciness.
After that, he sought a taste that was not spicy. The taste is not
spicy. then he sought for a spicy, and then tasted salty Seek not salty.
no more salty taste seeks salty taste get the taste and then look for
the unsavory taste one who acquires an unpleasant taste, then seeks a
sour taste; acquires a bitter taste, then seeks astringent; then seeks
another taste. Taste, then seek taste; Unpalatable; Taste; Uneat; Seek;
Taste; Cool, and seek. It tastes hot, and then seeks coolness. Those
brahmins had any taste. He does not delight in that taste, seeks other
tastes; then he is delighted with the enthusiasm, enthralled, fascinated
by the enthusiasm of all tastes. The pakcekasama Buddha had left. root

is free from boundaries. hence the name It doesn\'t make you feel
attracted to all the flavors. The word without lust that causes vain,
meaning lust, lust, saraga, etc. Abhijha lobha-Akusolmalu, do you say
that causes greed? as a cause for flux. causing that stagnation The
Pakcekasama Buddha had abandoned it. The roots were cut off and left no
place. Set like Tan Yod Duan to the absence later Let it not happen any
more normally. because of that Therefore, the Paccekasum Buddha is
called having no craving which causes illusory. hence the name Not
enthralled by tastes, no cravings that cause illusory. That the Buddha
only feeds himself, does not feed others, I call the person who does not
feed the people, who is firmly established. Then in Sara Dharma there is
no taint. The punishment was shunned and said to be a Brahmin.

Therefore, it is called the one who does not care for others. The word
one who travels in the order of the alleys means that in the morning,
the Paccekasum Buddha was hung sobong and took alms bowl and robe. go
into the garden or the settlement for alms Having a mental body, healed,
mindful, unsettled, holistic organic. Summarizes the eye, with a sense
of humor, leaving one surname to suju surname. One trip goes for alms,
therefore it is called not to feed the people, traveling in the order of
the alleys. \[783\] The word having a mind is not involved. In the
family, a bhikkhu is a person whose mind is involved for two reasons.
that is, one who sets oneself low, sets others high, has a mind that is
involved One who sets oneself up high, sets oneself low, has a mind
involved1. A monk is a person who sets himself low, sets others high.
How are they involved? The monk said that You have a lot of wealth to
your ego. Atma, robes, alms, senas, and ceremonial aids, because of your
dependence on you, and others. for your sake Therefore it is important
to give or to do for Atma. The name and family name of Yomma Yom, the
former father of Atma have been deteriorated. Atmayamaya said that I am
the cultivator of the worshiper. We are the group of laymen. Because of
you guys. A bhikkhu is the one who set himself low, set others high.
There is such an entanglement in mind. How does a bhikkhu set himself
high and lower others? The monk said that I have patronage Much to all
of you. By relying on your ego, you have reached the Buddha as your
refuge. to the Dharma Worshiping the Sangha as a refuge from slaughter
Sexual misconduct, false speech, and drunkenness are liquor and
intoxication, which is the premise of negligence. Atma gives aid,
exhortation, tells the Ubosot, prays for innovation. To all of you. when
it is so You have given up your ego. Worship, respect and worship
others. A bhikkhu is a person who sets himself high, sets others low,
this kind of enthusiasm. The word having a mind that is not entangled in
the family means that the Buddha is have a mind that is not entangled
Concerns in the family, abbots, robes, alms, Senasana and Kilan factors
in pharmaceuticals. Therefore it is called having a mind that is not
entangled in the family, one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn.
The Paccekasum Buddha then said that The Pacceka-sama Buddha does not
become addicted to tastes, does not have cravings, which cause
sloppiness and do not feed one\'s person. travel in the order of the
alleys having a mind that is not entangled in the family, should travel
