This branch (feat/pub) is specifically for prepping for publication on
suttacentral.net's Bilara system. I'm 90% sure I can automate building files in
the correct format rather than doing it manually, which is definitely desirable
considering I also plan on doing an in-depth revision sometime in 2023 based on
the Thai versions.

The repo to submit the data is at https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data

Note: as part of this revision I'll need to get rid of inline comments, expand
all remaining omitted sections, and most importantly, organize things to align
with the root texts in that repo. When it's ready, also see the _*.json files in
the repo, I think I'll need to get some data into one or more of those.
