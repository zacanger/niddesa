The Buddha has crossed over the flood and crossed over the flood.
The Buddha has crossed the flood and crossed over the flood. When the flood has crossed over the flood, the flood needs uncrowded, the grass top sharkles, and the grasses of life. And he has crossed over the flood,

That’s how the Buddha comes.
That’s how the Buddha doesn’t come back.

After hearing the word of Nāgas, they will listen to what they say. They will listen and pay homage to you. They will then listen to the instructions, and then depart.
