He knows all kinds of consciousness and phenomena as well. And the four reckoned as phenomena, know, “The seven planes of consciousness,”
He knew there are seven instances of consciousness, and the four reckonings of consciousness, know, “The four classes of consciousness and the seven reckoned as an instance.”

cnd18:21.2_0
How should the Fortunate One know and see four reckoning of consciousness?
How do the Fortunate One know about these four ways of consciousness?

cnd18:21.3_0
for this is said by the Buddha,

cnd18:21.4_0
“Mendicants, consciousness remains involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.
“Mendicants, consciousness remains involved with form, supported by form, grounded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.

cnd18:21.7_0
Or consciousness would remain involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.”

cnd18:21.8_0
So the Fortunate One knows four ways of consciousness,
So the Buddha knows the four reckonings of consciousness and understanding.

cnd18:22.1_0
And how do the Buddha know how are seven planes of consciousness?
How is the Fortunate One knowing how are these seven planes of consciousness?

cnd18:22.2_0
for this is said by the Buddha,

cnd18:22.3_0
“Mendicants, there are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception.

cnd18:22.4_0
men and some gods, the men who were reborn in the underworld,
“... some gods and some beings in the underworld.

cnd18:22.5_0
This is the first plane of consciousness.

cnd18:23.1_0
There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception, such as the gods reborn in Brahmā’s Host through the first absorption.

cnd18:23.2_0
This is the second plane of consciousness.

cnd18:24.1_0
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance.

cnd18:24.2_0
This is the third plane of consciousness.

cnd18:25.1_0
There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception, such as the gods replete with glory.

cnd18:25.2_0
This is the fourth plane of consciousness.

cnd18:26.1_0
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space.

cnd18:26.2_0
This is the fifth plane of consciousness.

cnd18:27.1_0
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness.

cnd18:27.2_0
This is the sixth plane of consciousness.

cnd18:28.1_0
There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness.

cnd18:28.2_0
This is the seventh plane of consciousness.”

cnd18:28.3_0
And the Buddha knows and sees in this way there are seven planes of consciousness.
In this way the Buddha knew and connection with consciousness,

cnd18:28.4_0
the consciousness of consciousness.
the consciousness of all consciousnesses.

cnd18:29.1_0
The Buddha is coming.

cnd18:30.2_0
The Realized One understands what he knows, and penetrates it.
The Realized One understands what he knows, and he penetrates it.

cnd18:30.3_0
for this is said by the Buddha,

cnd18:30.4_0
“Cunda, if a Realized One has untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.
“Cunda, if you haven’t untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.

cnd18:30.5_0
If a question about the past is true, real, and accurate, the Realized One does not answer.

cnd18:30.6_0
If a question about the past is true, real, and accurate, the Realized One answers with this question.
If a question about the past is true, real, and accurately, the Realized One answers to this point.

cnd18:30.7_0
Suppose a future ...

cnd18:30.8_0
If a question ...
If a question about the present is untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.

cnd18:30.9_0
If a question is true, real, and accurate in the present, the Realized One does not answer.
Suppose there is a present time that is true, real, and accurate. The Realized One does not answer.

cnd18:30.10_0
If a Realized One knows the right time, truthfully and substantively, it is beneficial for him to ask.
Suppose a Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what it is true, substantive, and beneficial.

cnd18:30.11_0
And so, Cunda, the Realized One has passed away in the past, future, and present. He is one who speaks on Dhamma, who speaks on discipline.
And so, Cunda, the Realized One has passed away in the past, future, and present. He is one who speaks on the meaning of the teaching and training.

cnd18:30.12_0
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

cnd18:31.1_0
In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.

cnd18:31.2_0
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

cnd18:31.3_0
From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.

cnd18:31.4_0
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

cnd18:31.5_0
The Realized One does as he says,
The Realized One does as he says.

cnd18:31.6_0
As he does, so he does.
As he spoke, so he does.

cnd18:31.7_0
Since this is so,

cnd18:31.8_0
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

cnd18:31.9_0
In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.

cnd18:31.10_0
That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.”
