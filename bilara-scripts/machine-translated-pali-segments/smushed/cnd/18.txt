who reveals the past,
is the first kind of person.

Venerable Possessing the venerable,
Looking on, Venerable Phagguṇa

unstirred, undisturbed.
unstirred, their doubts cut off.

Gone beyond all things,

I have come with a question,
There is a question that should be answered,

is the first person who takes the past.
is the first person who takes past lives.

whoever is the Buddha,
he who, Fortunate One, has true knowledge (supernatural) from the ground,

Unsullied in the past, future, and present, he attained to all things.
In regard to a teaching such as a noble disciple, having directly known, attained (perfection) imperishable things, and trying to understand all things in regard to all things.

In the past he was setting out on today and regarding the future in the past, future, and present.
In the past, future, and present.

How does the Fortunate One transgress the past?

After the Buddha had passed, there are two life-span, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths.
After his own birth, he reveals the beginning, middle, or end of the past. He remembers two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers:

For a thousand years ...
‘... for a thousand times ...

of a hundred thousand rebirths ...
of one hundred thousand aeons ...

at the ease of devotion ...
innumerable aeons of embryo,

many eons of expansion ...
Of many eons,

They reveal themselves in many ways:
innumerable aeons of evolution,

“There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

in this way the Fortunate One spoke about his own life thus:
In this way the Fortunate One tells his own teacher’s doctrine,

How does the Fortunate One transgress the past?
How do the Fortunate One seeks the past from the future?

The Buddha looks down on another one starting from birth.
The Buddha makes some proclamations regarding the past, future, and present.

They reveal themselves in many ways:
innumerable aeons of evolution,

“There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food.

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details.

In this way the Fortunate One enters the past,
So the Fortunate One tells others about the past,

Five hundred gold, silver, and money,
five hundred brothers, and then the Fortunate Ones, and his own brothers, Mahārukacchas and Suttas, and his own sons in the past, future individuals, presents, and his own giving birth of in the past and in the past, future a great liberated, bountiful (?) his own doctrine, and he genders for his own hands and feet, and his own giving the sun” (where elsewhere elsewhere, and in the past,

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Since the Realized One has given up three knowledges according to realization,
“Cunda, the Realized One has knowledge steming from memory.

He recollects as far as he wants.

In the future ...

Regarding the future, the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakening:

‘This is my last rebirth. Now there are no more future lives.’”

The Realized One’s knowledge of the face of sentient beings, insistence, and knowledge of the Realized One. He knows the teachings of sentient beings, in terms of strength, knowledge, and wisdom.
The Realized One is the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings, including knowledge, of the Realized One, and the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings, and knowledge of the Realized One. He is the truth of observation of knowledge, the Realized One. The Realized One is the power of knowledge, knowledge of the truth of the awakening factors, and the knowledge of the Realized One. The Realized One is the power of knowledge and vision of the Realized One.

In this way, when the Buddha explains himself in the past, future, and present, he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals the future.
In this way the Buddha explains himself in the past and future, and both of them explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals the beginning.

Greed ...
Greed is a root of greed ...

That craving is given up by the Buddha, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
That craving is given up by the Buddha, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

so the Buddha is unsteady.
That’s why the Buddha is a Buddha,

since they’ve given up desirelessness,
With the giving up of desire they’ve given up—

They don’t try to get it.
The Buddha doesn’t move or disturbance.

They don’t tremble or get lose their way, and don’t shake or tremble or get better.
suffering doesn’t tremble or wail or shake or rock or tremble.

uncertainty is what is meant.

doubt about suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
I’ll have no doubts or uncertainties about suffering.

When the Buddha has given up, cut off the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated it, and unable to arise in the future, as they letting go of knowledge and insight.
But when the Buddha has given up and cut off his knowledge, he has cut off the hindrance of doubt, cut off the letting go of all attachments, the to the inside, the top of a Buddha, and letting go of his know.

That’s why he’s declared
That’s why the Buddha foundation:

unstirred, undisturbed.
unstirred, their doubts cut off.

The Buddha has expelled all things.
The Buddha has reached the peak of all things.

They’re good because they don’t refer to rebirth there is no further existence.
He has no rebirth back to rebirth, there is no further rebirth;

Gone beyond all things,

There are some who come from questions. ...
There is a question that should be answered with a question ...

“Do you remember it, Sister?”
“They’re afraid, sirs.”

I have come with a question,

They perceive: ‘One who has attained the attainment of vision, while in blissful meditation in this very life, or in one who has been reborn in abiding in bliss there.’
They perceive someone who has attained the attainment of vision in bliss, or in one who has attained a happy abiding in bliss there.

This perception of forms,

When the four immaterial states have been immaterial attainments, they perceive that the perception of form has been eradicated through the ending of forms.
The four supports were immaterial states of meditation in the present life; and when the perception of matter is passed, they haven’t transcended the immaterial attainments.

Since they have given up all kinds of underlying tendency for form, their surmounting all forms, they’ve given upwards and cut off all attachments:
Since he has given up all identifying, all forms, surmounting all forms, and surmounting all kinds of becoming, he has abandoned the disappearance of what is given up in them.

There is no reason for this.

the consciousness of consciousness.
the consciousness of all consciousnesses.

The Buddha said the best:
said the Buddha,

the Realized One,
the Realised One, after seeing the Realised One.

he knows where it is.
to live on sesame,

they’re mortified, not awakened,
The mind’s mortal towards all

He knows all kinds of consciousness and phenomena as well. And the four reckoned as phenomena, know, “The seven planes of consciousness,”
He knew there are seven instances of consciousness, and the four reckonings of consciousness, know, “The four classes of consciousness and the seven reckoned as an instance.”

How should the Fortunate One know and see four reckoning of consciousness?
How do the Fortunate One know about these four ways of consciousness?

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Mendicants, consciousness remains involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.
“Mendicants, consciousness remains involved with form, supported by form, grounded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.

Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling ...

perception ...

Or consciousness would remain involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature.”

So the Fortunate One knows four ways of consciousness,
So the Buddha knows the four reckonings of consciousness and understanding.

And how do the Buddha know how are seven planes of consciousness?
How is the Fortunate One knowing how are these seven planes of consciousness?

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Mendicants, there are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception.

men and some gods, the men who were reborn in the underworld,
“... some gods and some beings in the underworld.

This is the first plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception, such as the gods reborn in Brahmā’s Host through the first absorption.

This is the second plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance.

This is the third plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception, such as the gods replete with glory.

This is the fourth plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space.

This is the fifth plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness.

This is the sixth plane of consciousness.

There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness.

This is the seventh plane of consciousness.”

And the Buddha knows and sees in this way there are seven planes of consciousness.
In this way the Buddha knew and connection with consciousness,

the consciousness of consciousness.
the consciousness of all consciousnesses.

The Buddha is coming.
said the Buddha,

The Fortunate One, after namely the brahmin Posālaka,
The Buddha, Pātikāsa, given the brahmin Palace.

The Buddha has designated Māra’s statements, that is,
“It’s terminator ...”

The Buddha said the best:
said the Buddha,

the Realized One extols.
the Realized One exalted:

The Realized One understands what he knows, and penetrates it.
The Realized One understands what he knows, and he penetrates it.

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Cunda, if a Realized One has untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.
“Cunda, if you haven’t untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.

If a question about the past is true, real, and accurate, the Realized One does not answer.

If a question about the past is true, real, and accurate, the Realized One answers with this question.
If a question about the past is true, real, and accurately, the Realized One answers to this point.

Suppose a future ...

If a question ...
If a question about the present is untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply.

If a question is true, real, and accurate in the present, the Realized One does not answer.
Suppose there is a present time that is true, real, and accurate. The Realized One does not answer.

If a Realized One knows the right time, truthfully and substantively, it is beneficial for him to ask.
Suppose a Realized One knows the right time to speak so as to explain what it is true, substantive, and beneficial.

And so, Cunda, the Realized One has passed away in the past, future, and present. He is one who speaks on Dhamma, who speaks on discipline.
And so, Cunda, the Realized One has passed away in the past, future, and present. He is one who speaks on the meaning of the teaching and training.

That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One.

That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise.

That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

The Realized One does as he says,
The Realized One does as he says.

As he does, so he does.
As he spoke, so he does.

Since this is so,

That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.

In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power.

That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.”

the Realized One,
the Realised One, after seeing the Realised One.

And the Buddha knows that it is just the same as before.
And the Buddha knows each higher stage thus: “Kholder, he knows right here and now, and it is the kind of work.”

“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.”

Here the Buddha knows, knows how deeds created by deeds,
Here the Buddha knows that work likewise,

“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in the animal realm.”
“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they’ll be reborn in the animal realm.”

Here the Buddha knows, knows how deeds created by deeds,
Here the Buddha knows that work likewise,

“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in the ghost realm.”

Here the Buddha knows, knows how deeds created by deeds,
Here the Buddha knows that work likewise,

“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they will arise.”

Here the Buddha knows, knows how deeds created by deeds,
Here the Buddha knows that work likewise,

“When this person’s body breaks up, after death, they’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”
“When this person is practicing in heavenly realm, when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.”

for this is said by the Buddha,

“When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’

When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person ... will be reborn in the animal realm.’

When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in the company of the ghost realm.’

When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person is proceeding in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in humans.’
‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in the human realm.’

When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’

When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand:

‘This person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that they will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’”

he knows where it is.
to live on sesame,

they’ve gained the goal for which they relieve.
The heedless one, ~ (alternatively) everywhere.

By means of clinging to sickness,
devoted to the dimension of nothingness:

Intent on the liberations, I’ll realize the supreme liberation of the beautiful.
I’ll realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life.

The Buddha knows

“This person is intent on sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They are dedicated to the seats, and thoughts. They’re dedicated to the kind of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. Their ultimate goal is committed to the first absorption. They are committed to the attainment of the dimension of nothingness, and thoughts of neither perception nor non-perception. They’re dedicated to the realization of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They’re dedicated to having good families. They’re dedicated to having attained the second absorption.
“This person is intent on visible objects. They are committed to the end of the dimensions of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They are committed to the ending of attachments. They are committed to the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the liberation of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. They are committed to the practice that respect. They are committed to the remarkindness due to the abode. They’re dedicated to the weades, alms-foobjectortions, pervasion, lodgings, and medicines, and supplies of the attainment of the attainment of the fourth absorption, the attainment of the attainment of the attainment of the fourth absorption, and the attainment of the attainment of the attainment of the attainment of the attainment of the fourth absorption, and the attainment of the emns.

When that has passed, ceased, and perished, in the dimension of nothingness, the result of past deeds, future rebirth, and present.
The result of that same deed, in the same way, the result of that same deed, created a new state of existence,

The Buddha knows

“This person is made up of sights ...
“This person is reborn in the realm of luminous form ...

The attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”
the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.”

I’ve already attained it.”
I’m dedicated to the gods.”

Knowing the origin of nothingness,

we have not transcended the fetters.
Such is not the fetter of the fetters.

A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,

then sees clearly.

this is real knowed for him.
this is real knowed for him:

the accomplished brahmin!

Knowing this is called ‘accumulation’.
Having known the origin of nothingness, they are called ‘accumulation through nothingness’.

Knowing that it was’s possible for the dimension of nothingness, and that it is the connection with the dimension of nothingness, they knew the absentence of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, and after considering it aside. He having known it as a debtermined.
Knowing the dimension of nothingness, they knew the dimension of nothingness, and the destiny, the producing of becoming consequence of consciousness, and understanding that confined the fire of the dimension of nothingness, and removed them. He then seized him, saying,

Knowing the origin of nothingness,

relishing is said to be not fettered.

Having known that deed and ill will, the fire consumed by greed, hate and delusion,,, but being unable to comprehend the legal procedures of the fetter of reading the fetters, they rose up into the air and feeling, after discussing them, they apply themselves to him,
Knowing that deed was prepared for him, and having considered that deed, the fire-haired, burned and cast off the top, spring on the reed. Then, having understood (these), they applyed the fetters and attain the fire.

And so it is phrases with fleeze from openings filled with phrases; and the lotus phrases touched by phrases.
And so it is phrases by comparison with Pokkharasāti, full of embowls, owls, rice, and suitable water, thinking:

from relishing.
Such is not the fetter of the fetters.

Having directly known this with his direct knowledge, he investigates that his insight thus, and attained discovering me,
But after directly knowing this that this is the case, and having directly known it to him, he developed insight, and lost it.

A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,

Then they will remove those.
And he’ll endeavour.

He entered the dimension of nothingness, and emerges from that, he goes beyond suffering and discomfort, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
After entering the dimension of nothingness, and emerging from that, he proclaims what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable, which is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.

As they do so, they look at it and discern it.
if he sees an escape from it as escape from it; he looks at it, becomes exceeding it again and again, saying,

then sees clearly.

Knowing this is true, real, and accurate.
This knowledge is real, but it is ignorant.

this is real knowed for him.
this is real knowed for him:

the accomplished brahmin!

Seven things were spoken to by Brahmā.
Seven things are called a brahmin ...

This person is said to be a trainee who hasn’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.
The Realized One’s disciple is said to be the uninterrupted, unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.

I’ve completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.
When the perfected one has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment.

That’s what he’s done with, crossed over, and gone beyond rebirth.
He has completed the transmigration: birth and death are freed from rebirth and death.

now there’ll be no more future lives.
there are no future lives for them.

The Buddha replied,

“Knowing of nothingness,
