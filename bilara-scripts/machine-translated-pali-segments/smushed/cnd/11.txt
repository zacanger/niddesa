How is this fitting without asking permission? How is it that they ask? What is the point of without asking? How can we ask without asking permission?
How is it fitting to ask and not ask without questioning, “What is it?”

Do they say he is a sage because he has knowledge

Eight attainments have the eight factors. When someone is started, they say:
They say, ‘There are eight attainments for one who is starting with knowledge, or else one who has entered upon them.’ And they explain it to him when they fall, they say,

Do they say he is a sage because he has knowledge

Or because of the life that upholstered and the life of purity, adultery, rude, and preventing cattle, comprisy, and rude: this is its property and fit for grain.
Or because of the life force, or because they fall for it, or if they don’t earn a living by lazy, hostile, phlegm, and calm, consume this, or that they frequently practiced warriors, frequentlystructed lamps.

Or because of the life he leads?

Hence that brahmin thought,
The brahmin then thought,

Of those who are skilled in the elements of the sense fields, skilled in the dimension of infinite space, skilled in the dimension of infinite consciousness, skilled in the dimension of nothingness, or skilled in the sense faculties, skilled in emerging from the four bases of psychic power, and skilled in the mindfulness meditation subjects, and is skilled in the unprofitable or excessive. Their five faculties are skilled in the skillful, embracing from the unskillful, searchessence, and fruition to activity.

I do not say that all ascetics and brahmins
(But) I do not say that all ascetics and brahmins,

when he Nandā
And he said the Buddha Nandā,

are enveloped in birth and old age:

whoever here has given up (reliance on) what is seen,

heard, or sensed, and virtue and practices,

and has also given up all the countless (other) ways,

who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free -

they’re not swept away by floods.
they don’t call them a flood.

I don’t say that all those ascetics and brahmins is restrained by birth, old age, and death; I say.
Yet I don’t say that all those ascetics and brahmins have gone beyond old age, they’re not concealed by birth. I say.

There are ascetics and brahmins who have given up rebirth, old age, and death, assert them, so that I teach them, establish them, discovered them, opened up, analyzed them, and make it known.
There are ascetics and brahmins who have given up rebirth and old age and death, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that I’m unable to arise in the future. I declare: ‘I’m clearly declared: ‘I am the teaching.’

All those ascetics and brahmins, Nanda, I say.
Yet I do not say that all ascetics and brahmins have a fixed destiny.

They give up all identifying. They, having seen what they haven’t seen, heard, and thought, and known all, having given up all suffering.
After giving up all (working) what is seen, heard, thought, and known, he gives up all, and substaining it all, he departs, having given up all suffering.

After giving up all these purity of mindfulness meditation. ...
All after giving up purity of mind,

Those who have given up purity of mindfulness,
all those who are released from all sense pleasures,

None of those who are restrained in this way,
Those who have seen that cleansed purification in this way are abandoned

Those who are virtuous
Those who are virtuous of virtue,

Those who, having given up everything,
Those who have given up everyone,

After giving up all discomfort, they give up the precepts and observances, but then, without giving them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.
After giving up all precepts and observances, he gives up all these precepts and observances, but then, having given them up, he departs.

whoever has given up (reliance on) what is seen, heard, and thought,

And he gives up all four flaws.
And after giving up all of using uncontrolled gold coins, cleansing the pure flawless, free of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable, having given up all knowledge and freedom,

and has also given up all the countless (other) ways,

who has completely understood craving and is without pollutants, I say.
I say that craving is completed, without pollutants, I say.

craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.

craving for craving, and then completely understood three cravings:
When craving is completely understood, one who has completely understood the three cravings and the complete understanding of craving,

They completely understand relatives,
and completely understanding the course of relatives,

What is completely understood?
What is the end of relatives?

craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.
craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. This is craving for touches.

This is the completely understood.
this is the end of relatives,

What are the three completely understood?
What are the three perils that completely understand?

After doing so, craving for relatives is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
So you’ve done what leads to your relatives.

What is the escape from sound.
Regarding an escape from it:

This is the completely understood.
This is the way of completely understanding.

What, which, having completely understood?
What is the completely understanding of giving up?

Thus, having given up craving, they give up craving, get rid of, eliminate, and obliterate those thoughts.
So when you give up craving, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it.

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Mendicants, give up desire and greed for craving.

Thus that craving will be given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.”
In this way that craving will be given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.”

This is the completely understanding of giving up.
This is the end of giving up.

who has completely understood craving for craving and complete understanding, and who has completely understood these three cravings,
When craving is completely understood, these three cravings do so after completely understood them.

Four defilements:

the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.

Those who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them—
These are the defilements that lead to the future. They’re cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free -

So I say that they don’t have crossed over the flood.
So I don’t tell them how to cross over the flood.

who, by fully knowing craving, are pollutant-free, I say.
I say that craving is completely understood, the undefiled in you,

Abandoning is simply present. They are called defilements with the aggregates.
(They are) components that are called the aggregates, the defilements and the defilement of the corruptions.

For the ending of attachments, the ending of attachments, the ending of attachments, and the deathless.
Calmness is the vital condition for attachments; it’s the culmination of attachments, and the deathless.

Gotama, well-controlled,
Gotamaks, well-free:

They give up all identifying. They, having seen what they haven’t seen, heard, and thought, and known all, having given up all suffering.
After giving up all (working) what is seen, heard, thought, and known, he gives up all, and substaining it all, he departs, having given up all suffering.
