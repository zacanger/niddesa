one gone forth is produced by craving, one is unique in the sense of calm, and one of the passions. The Buddha makes an end of all defilements.
one gone forth is very one, with no yoke. One was not exhausted by one, who had gone forth trained in the company of the gods. One with no steadfast headed by the Buddha, one with the dark and one gone forth, one with the supreme perfect awakening.

The Fortunate One has allowed one gone forth
“How do the Fortunate One has gone forth like this?

Only the Buddha spoke ill of the young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life; and he does socialize with his mother and father; brothers with his children and grandchildling them; and having cut off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.
On the Buddha, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I’ll cut off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness.

So the Fortunate One has gone forth alone,
the Fortunate One has gone forth like this.

How does the Buddha get alone?
How do the Fortunate One consents in one way?

When they’ve gone forth they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.

He walks alone, returns alone, sits down alone, and lays down in private alone. He walks alone, returns alone, sat in private, and concentrates on walking mindfully alone.
He remains alone, returns alone, sits down in private alone; he walks alone, returns alone, sat down alone, and lays down; he walks alone; he walks alone, returns alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on the noble ones.

So the Buddha is one personal.
So the Buddha says in the sense of bones.

How is the Fortunate One alone with that craving?
How is the Fortunate One in the sense of having given up craving?

So that’s what he did.
When they live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they don’t abandon him at the foot of a tree, on the bank of the Bodhi tree, and don’t give up craving.

“Craving is a person’s partner

as they transmigrate on this long journey.

They go from this state to another,
their coming and going,

but don’t escape transmigration.

that craving is the cause of suffering—

Rid of craving, free of grasping,

to give up sensual desire.

Thus the Fortunate One, having given up craving, one too

And how does the Buddha someone without greed
How is the Buddha one free of greed?

When greed has been given up, one is completely given up, one who has given up greed, hate, and delusion.
When they’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have given them up, one with a deluded mind.

That is called ‘a person who has crossed over the deathless’.
They’ve confounded the deathless: the ending of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.

Will you go on, Piṅgiya, conflict with the far shore? Way to the far shore?

Who, having heard the sage,
hearing a sage’s word,

the sage who knows modes, is called the knowledge of the chains.
the renown is said to be the sage who does not cling to these things.

Having heard what the words, their head exploresed, (saying): “Hearing what you have heard, Saged, and next, he steps to your dwellings, saying,
Having heard your speech, the termite-mound, having heard your speech, he proclaimed the following words: “Hearing your advice, he picked up a starting point and put it on, saying,

there are five kinds of roofing material:

Desire for craving (wrong) view, the defilements, the six bad destiny, the pollutants,
Deformed by craving, the dart of craving, the defilements, the pollutant of ignorance, the giver of ignorance.

These six kinds of Buddha have given up, cut off the stomach, and the rolls of the sunshade, spit out, and wide,
These six things have been given up and cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

That’s why the Buddha, Vaccha,

The Buddha has given them up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.

Therefore the Buddha became awakened.
So the Buddha said to the snake:

Three words are poets:
There are three kinds of eloquence:

His questions are divided, eloquent, andeloquent.
the eloquence of meaning is that he should be lifted up by questioning.

What is the exposition?
What is the way of eloquence?

If someone memorizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in prosecution with verses, exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses;
Or take someone whose verse was spoken in the Buddha’s instructions, verses, inspired exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing accounts, and analyses;

supported by him,
he supported him in the same way.

This is the exposition concerning the teaching.
this is the way of eloquence.

What is proper for questioning?
What is the questioning of the accused?

It’s when someone asks them about something, but they’re discovered to be possible.
It’s when someone has asked about both the meaning and the characteristics, and because of the actual manner of about it.

Experiencing him about this,
Relying on this he asks question,

This is the hide of questioning.
This is the exposition that should be responsible.

What is the acceptance of a distinct?
What is the right way?

He has attained the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. ...

His relatives is the truth, Dhamma is well-known.
It is the meaning of that relative is well-known.

It is indeed the meaning, the teaching, and the well-known family.
It is indeed the meaning, the teaching, the Dhamma, and the usual way.

the knowledge of these three knowledges,
the knowledge of these three knowledges, the analytical knowledges,

And by this discrimination the Buddha, having attained analytic knowledge, endowed, truly attained,
With this analytical knowledge of the discrimination he is endowed, entered upon,

So you should discuss the Buddha,
That’s why the Buddha,

whoever has no questions, whether there is no choice, no fame, and including,
who can lend an ear, he does not get rid of it, nor can he agree with him?

The Realized Ones are called purification, who are Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, the Perfect Sambuddhas, and the Perfect Sambuddhas have subdued,
Surely now the Realized Ones are free of defilements, and those who are perfected ones, who have ended the defilements,

These are called purity.
These are called the reasons to purification in.

After having directly known that “Buddha” is purified. He understood himself in this way: “Purpassī interrupted knowledge,” the Buddha, and having directly known that purity, he fell into discovers the truth, saying,
The Buddha thought: “Practice absorption, it is due to subtlety, of insight due to disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding insight, the attainment of vision, and having directly experienced these.”

In this way, the Buddha reflected on those teachings,
The Buddha knows that his own dispensation, penetrating another hypotheses, saying,

all the other is the confirmation.

The Buddha made an end of his questions thus, making them unshakable. Here the limits of the questions one who transmigration brings about the boundaries.
The Fortunate One, having asked questions, the Teacher, an enlightener of the questions, performs a deliberate, making it unshakable.

Dismission of the influence of such a (good) delimitation of the inner skin, making a limit of deluge.

the Teacher, the Buddha,
Since the Blessed One is hurried,

Just as a caravan leader crosses the robber on a desert, does not endure criminals, robbers, or swords and shields, thinking, “Indeed, they plaster,”
Just as a caravan leader crosses the desert safely, robbers in the caravan, or in the debt, so that when there was a snake or a thief makes it bad karma with a monk, he prevents it on the ground.

Just so the Fortunate One is dwelling near a hundred times.
Just so the Fortunate One is always mindful,

But the Buddha is really caravan leader.
And that’s how the Buddha caravan .

Then the Buddha described in the land of the birds, seats, and also inspires confidence in his heart:
Then the Buddha describes them in the direction, having covetousness and confidence, and that is incompetent,lazy, and trust in those who have faith and confidence, and that is independent of others.

Or again, the Buddha gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path, the way that leads to the assembly.
So the Buddha explained the unarisen path, later, gave rise to the unarisen path, explained the unexplained path. He knows the path to the company of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path. And now we have now explained the Blessed Ones.

the Teacher who makes an end to questions,

Taking opposite, they claim: ‘I am doubting and uncertainties of jealousy, criticizing, and have come to see. They come and are free of greed, hate, and delusion. They come to an end. They’re free of greed, hate, and delusion.
doubts come and seem to be free of doubt. They come backbiting and blemish defilements. They come and go where they want, without trouble or difficulty. They come back. They are free of greed, hate, and delusion. They come backbliding and embarrassed, having fallen into greedy, free of greed, hate, and delusion.
