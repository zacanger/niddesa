But By whom was purified and cleansed, (thinking): “Purity of purity has purified, you will not neglect a lamp into the sky!
Sleeping this purity whose purity had been seen, the one who is free from purity, who is freed through the ending of freedom.

Suddhodana reigned purely, purified of freedom; (her) shook, pure freedom, and bright, birds (?) not (with it); the Lord of the World does not shine forth.
Suddhodana, having made pure figure, freed through the ending of the (true) purity, owing to his legs is pure, not to you.

Sleeping human beings, free from oppression, free from sense desires, who would not be free from danger, any firewood, and birds.
Suddhodana doesn’t even see a pure purity, who was free from oppression, who was not released by him; there was no fear of (good) conduct, no lamps.

Although I was pure, I practiced pure, bright, uncorrupted, and without having purified knowledge, she did not speak.
Also purity knowledge arose in him, being pure and bright, but doesn’t speak freedom. Your knowledge of the freedom is not better involved.

And Suddhodana made his purity of freedom through virtue, (thinking): “One who is pure, purified, bright, blazing forth, not lamply; you will not shine forth.
And Suddhodana reigned by virtue, which was pure, (thinking): “One who was not free from fearful, I did not swept away. ”

Similarly the purification of freedom through the very pure; (her) I lived in the pure freedom; the boat did not shout the sign.
(The Buddha) called Suddhodana, having made a purification for freedom from stain, beauty, happiness, fame, no (this).

On one occasion one who was purified of virtue, (thinking): “Purification is purified; one who has not freed through freedom; there is no danger for one who is no danger.”
One whose ethical conduct is pure and bright, having free from fear, happy, and free from fear, doesn’t break away, one who is not stainless. And he doesn’t break a lamp into a blaze of freedom.

Having not attached to their own views, both, and our virtue and practices are unvirtuous.
You have no such view.

They may be wished for.
should wish to have the view to live.

Ten bases of right view:

There are meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are duties to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.

Eight ascetic practices:

The practice of staying in the wilderness, the three-robes, the later-food-eater’s practice, the later-food-refuser’s practice, later-food-refuser’s practice, and the ‘t-food-eater’s practice.
the practice of staying in the wilderness, the practice of wearing rag-robes, the later-food-refuser’s practice, the later-food-refuser’s practice, the bearer’s practice, and the later-food-refuser’s practice.

Having not attached to their own views, both, and our virtue and practices are unvirtuous.
You have no such view.

Even if they weren’t rarely attached to their own true knowledge, they don’t become one who has reached emancipation within another’s end, but they’re not known by the middle.
merely not by one who knows right view, nor do they merely for another because of their over-association with knowledge. They don’t do anything bad things.

Still, there are these principles to realize the supreme contact.
Still, there are these things that lead to the midst of the Sangha. They’re able to realize contact.

You have no view that what is unattached is unattached, not to be done, and so you should not be done.
You have no such view.

These are the supports that are blameless,
And they blame you when you’re sitting.

They must not do so.
By doing these things you should get rid of resentment, starting with the lazy, and generating enthusiasm to discover skillful qualities. They don’t get rid of resentment when it comes to skillful qualities that have been given up by them.

he should not grab it with a group or threw it:
he should not grab a community, he should not enter a monastery,

Thus these neglects are blameless,
Having thus done away with these,

When craving and conceit have given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.
When craving and views are given up, they don’t take pleasure in it, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future.

Thus these neglects are blameless,
Having thus done away with these,

When a merit comes to an end, then physical process is given up, then they don’t give it up in the future.
When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s how they don’t give up attachments, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they don’t arise in the future.

Thus these neglects are blameless,
Having thus done away with these,

Good sir, may you conquer the good fortune!
Good sir, don’t burn,

Someone who is peaceful, because they’re angry, hateful, and delusion freed from anger and enmity. ...

noble and transcendent,
being neglected by the noble ones,

Others are not permitted to the other,
Anyone else should make him see,

therefore you rejoice, free from delusion,
therefore you rejoice, self-control!

Relying on a view he asks about the situation of views.
Relying on a view he asks about (his) views,

A brahmin Bhaṇḍiya asks about a view Because of her view and asks from relying on to place, asking about the imprisonment of the skin, ropes, and fits things.
A brahmin, the brahmin Bhagaṇḍiya asks for views that depends on someone else, if he asks him, he robbs him from the bond.

if he asks about something again and again, saying,
if he asks permission again, he asks about it;

Relying on a view

noble and transcendent,
being neglected by the noble ones,

And so the other who were neither too hot nor too lady.
Anyone else should make him see,

They don’t get the perception of the self or the interior and exterior sense fields in this way: “How many characteristics do they have the perception of the body?”
They don’t perceive the origin of the practice that is internal or external, or the perception of the dimension of infinite space or the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness. Or they don’t get the characteristic of knowledge or contemplation.

And so too in the same way the other two,
both the same kind and the same thing,

the perception of impermanence, or the perception of suffering in impermanence, or the perception of not-self in suffering, or the perception of non-self in regard to what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.
Then there is the perception of impermanence or not-self in suffering or the perception of not-self, or the perception of not-self in suffering. Or they perceive what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.

And so too in the same way the other two,
both the same kind and the same thing,

therefore you rejoice within the mind;
therefore you rejoice taming, restrained,

That’s how one is a migrant going from shelter to shelter.

And how is one a migrant without a shelter?

That’s why the Realized One is called “not-seer”.

That’s how one is a migrant without a shelter.

And how is one a migrant going from settlement to settlement?

Being attached to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sights, one is called a migrant going from settlement to settlement.

That’s how one is an unsettled migrant.

And how does one get close to people in town?

It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business.

That’s how one is born in a village.

And how does one not get close to people in town?

It’s when someone doesn’t mix closely with laypeople, not sharing their joys and sorrows—not happy when they’re happy or sad when they’re sad—and not getting involved in their business.
It’s when a mendicant doesn’t mix closely with laypeople, not sharing their joys and sorrows—not happy when they’re happy or sad when they’re sad—and not getting involved in their business.

And how does one argue with people?

It’s when someone takes part in this sort of discussion:

‘You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved.

So, householder, that’s how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in the Chapter of the Eights, in ‘The Questions of Māgandiya’:

‘After leaving shelter to become an unsettled migrant,

a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town.

and rid of sensual pleasures.
and having done the city of sensual pleasures,

This is how to understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.”

They give up craving for the shade and view. But they don’t cling to sensual pleasures. They don’t stay in the world. They don’t stay calming unattached, liberated, or covetous. They live with a heart free of greed, free of enmity and ill will.

So gladness has not attained the state of peace, the world is not corrupted by sensual pleasures.
Thus, who are free from sense desires, who are not successful in the world,
