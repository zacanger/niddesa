When they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, they’re a dart of diseases, afflicted with a dart, suffering, and observed. And as they do so—and a disease, a poison, burning, blazing, and glowing. Both the drawbacks, and not liable to originate, they are unable to grow old.

What is the completely understanding of giving up?

mnd2:106.2_0
After giving up desire and greed, they give up desire and greed for contact.

mnd2:106.3_0
for this is said by the Buddha,

mnd2:106.4_0
