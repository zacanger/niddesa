if he thinks, “This is mine, this is where there’s anything left over, this is,” and she gives up feeling ... perception ... choices ... consciousness that come up. Their perception is dispelled, contemplated, and disgusted by form.

mnd15:169.4_0
I have no such reason.

mnd15:170.2_0
“Mendicants, this body doesn’t belong to you or to anyone else.

mnd15:170.3_0
It’s old deeds, and should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as something to be experienced.
It’s old deeds, and should be seen as produced by choices and intentions, as something to be felt.

mnd15:170.4_0
In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself:

mnd15:170.5_0
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.
‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises; due to the cessation of choices, that ceases. That is: conditioned phenomenon; due to the cessation of choices.

mnd15:170.6_0
That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.
and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.

mnd15:170.7_0
When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease.

mnd15:170.8_0
That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”

mnd15:170.9_0
I have no such reason.
and so there is no such thing in others.

mnd15:171.1_0
For this is said by the Buddha,
For this was said by the Buddha,
