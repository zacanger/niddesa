The ascetic has not been spoken of by the ascetics whom he has taught and pointed them out. A mendicant who has broken off defilement, stubbornment, and given them analyzed them, but being free from defilements with the three roots, namely, discovered, clear, and made them clear.
The ascetic has been spoken of by an ascetic, the brahmin who has been given up by the things spoken of by the ascetics, brahmins, the one who is skilled in defilement, and the one who is free from the corruptions. He has been discovered and clearly described as the root of the defilements, and so on.

Now, this is called an ascetic.

This is what they’re not causing,
This is not so, Yama,

They give rise to desire.
With the ending of darkness they give up desire for them.

She produces pleasure and pain because of the ear that is likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the production of pleasure and happiness. Relying on an activity of desire, whatever is born.
It depends on pleasure and pain that make you a wish, and pleasure and pain arise in him. Relying on an aristocrat, brahmins, merchant, or workers.

and one who gives up desire.
With the giving up of darkness,

Seeing a new state of existence in form,
Seeing forms, you’re reborn and die;

The four great elementals and the four primary elements,
These are the four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements.

What is continuation of sights?
What is continued existence?

It is the production of sights that appears, born, and appearing.
The arising of continuations regarding sights, rebirth, and manifestation of rebirth is produced.

this is the attachment to continuation.
this is the attachment to continued existence.

What is the discontinuation of sights?
What is the ending of sights?

The ending of sights is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.

this is the disappearance of sights.
it is the disappearance of sights.

Seeing them, they’ve lost their state of existence for rebirth in the realm of luminous forms and seem to be discovered, infatuated, and manifested aside, he surely abides in them.
Seeing them, they perish. Then, having seen the cause of existences and the dispelling of rebirth in the realm of luminous forms, because of subsequently, he became self-controlled and mass of suffering.

Seeing that in regard to forms,
Seeing that for sights, and future lives,

that doesn’t tremble at the world.
Kusinārā arises in the world.

So two kinds of distributors:
Two kinds of dispelling:

purification from the bonds of craving and views,
The attachment to craving and the many different views,

How do they make a deliberation of craving?
How do they build up craving for craving?

Take someone who gives wealth, and they don’t arise for wealth.
When someone has not arisen, they do not arise.

They think:

“How can I arise or not?”
“How can I arise and not arise, so that wealth arises to me?”

But when they have such things, they don’t arise in me, or once arisen they don’t arise.
But when they have such alcoholic drinks that cause negligence, they don’t arise, or if they’ve already arisen they don’t arise.

When you roam out of your gambling discontent, you don’t arise in me, or once arisen they don’t arise.
When roaming the streets at night, they don’t arise and don’t arise.

When bad friends don’t arise, they’ve already arisen.

and don’t arise in someone who enjoys these things.”
and frequenting festivals. When frequenting festivals arise, they don’t arise, if they’ve already arisen, they don’t give their wealth.”

That’s how the task is done.
That’s how the craving is performed.

Then a farmer, a trader, a cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.
Then all the farmers, traders, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions.

That’s how the task is done.
That’s how the craving is performed.

How does one act in this way?
How do they make a view?

They know that the eye had arisen,
They know

if he knows that it was given to me when the eye had arisen, he knows it;
he knows that he has arisen in the eye,

“It’s no trouble me, I have disappeared.”
“My self has vanished.”

That’s how, too, performs a view.
That too is how one acts in this way.

I’ve given up desire for the ear ...

As for form,

When you’ve heard about sounds ...
The Realized One has given up desire for sounds ...

They know disagreeable tangibles:
he knows about touches that have arisen in him:

She knows how to touch me was given when I had arisen.
he knows that tangibles had arisen, he knows:

“It’s no trouble me, I have disappeared.”
“My self has vanished.”

Thus they perform misconception in the many kinds of view.
That is how someone makes such views, produces, and because of that view.

Contacts don’t experience sights.

The four great elementals and bodily-form derived from the great elementals.
The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements.

When forms arise, they’re disturbed in form:
The elements of form in brief, the four ways:

Through knowing for truth, having abandoned exceedingly abandoned, through abandoning the path
through abandoning of relatives, through abandoning what is to be destroyed, by abandoning the plane of planes.

What kind of form is produced?
What is a form that has been realized?

They know form:
They know form,

“All form is the four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements.”
“Anything at all that is the four primary elements,”

Such is how form is known.

What is it that aroused with truth?
What is realised?

Having made a form like this, they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable. Disciplined, they’re free of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.
When a relatives live in this way, having made a disease as an abscess, dart, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. I am the drawback, they’re not liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, as suffering, as diseased, as an abscess, as a dart, as misery, as an affliction, as alien, as falling apart, as empty, as not-self.

Thus they have come to be overcome by form.
This is how it comes to be known.

What is it that form has abandoned?
What is one who abandons bodily form that is purified?

After giving up desire and greed for form, they give up desire and greed for it.
After giving up desire and greed for form, they give up desire and greed for form.

for this is said by the Buddha,

“Mendicants, give up desire and greed for form.

Thus that form will be given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.”

Such is how form is abandoned, overcome by,
Through abandoning bodily form one is overcome,

How does form become clear?
What is realised with form?

There are four immaterial attainments that have been gained, and those who have disturbed, passed away, and transcended.
The four immaterial attainments have been reborn in the formless states, ~ and there are beings subtle and passed away.

Thus they have transcended form.
That’s how to surmount form has been realized.

These are the four bodily formations that are agitated.
These are the four reasons that a form is produced.

Contacts don’t experience sights.

When the ground is exceedingly seen and comprehended with sights, five people don’t experience contact.
When the ground is disrobed and the sky has passed away, they don’t experience contact.

Contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
There is contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

Contacts don’t experience sights.

The Buddha replied,

“Eye consciousness arises dependent on the mind and bodily contact.
“Name and form are conditions,

Desire, possessiveness.
The sources are found.

I wish to die,
don’t want to die,

Contacts don’t experience sights.”

What does that form agree with?
How do you live together?

And when you’re happy,
And when you’re driven by happiness,

They know that it’s mung beans to me.
in this way they transcend me.

when I knew you as my mind was,
Understanding that his mind was enemy.

What kind of person does it favoring?
How do you live together?

How do you get rid of this? How has someone else to do this? How do you get rid of the sight that is? How does one who goes beyond doubt, got rid of injured, eliminated, and obliterated?
How do you get rid of this? How do you get rid of the sight, how does one live happily? How does one feel lost when they don’t get rid of the form of it?

What does that form agree with?
How do you live together?

What pleasure and pain?
What pleasure and pain are given up and disagreeable?

And when you’re happy,
And when you’re driven by happiness,

They rape me this, as it were.
surely they lose this one.

In this case I ask you about what I ask, that which is why I ask, and that I converse with,
In this case I ask, whatever I ask, for permission I ask, for confidence in the midst of others:

this is that:
this is that, this is:

He explains to me assert, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals to me.

that’s how I said.
This is my hawk.

They scrutinize, swamped, and distracted to readily go beyond, they’ve transcended all over.
They shine and transgress, just as they go beyond, they’re reborn in the passing away and reappearing.

They know that it’s mung beans to me.
in this way they transcend me.

when I know that my mind was (safeguard):
Knowing this, my mind was enlightened.

If I found out about it, I’d known as if I were to know it newly know it, and I’d give it up.”
If I understand that it would be known, I would allow you to understand, and let him know.

Such was my mind, my thought, and it was my consciousness.”
Such was my mind, my it felled and thought. And so it was my consciousness, and my consciousness was like that.

saying: “My mind is mine.”
thus the mind is what I had known.

That monk was stored away.
That’s why he was created,

“What do you agree with the sight?
“What is the shackle?

And when you’re happy,
And when you’re driven by happiness,

They know that it’s mung beans to me.
in this way they transcend me.

mind is my name.”
May you know me as my mind!”

Perceiving perception nor non-percipient,
perception ...

he does not perceive what is distorted,
he does not perceive what is intended.

when it comes to form,
when they realize this truth,

For perception is the source of perception,
For perception is the source of perception.

Perceiving perception nor non-percipient,
perception ...

Perceiving perception is called to be known as perception, and when standing they are present.
perception is called both “perception”.

Not understanding is insane, they do not derange—
Not understanding their own goal, they are insane, not among those who are dead—

Perceiving perception nor non-percipient,
perception ...

he does not perceive what is distorted, but he perceives it as such.
he does not perceive what is false and exercise.

these are called “excluded”. And too, when someone has ceased and not reborn in the next life,
They are called “non-percipient form” and “non-percipient form”.

These are called the four kinds of gain and honor.
They are said to be the four kinds of gaining material possessions.

he does not perceive what is distorted,
he does not perceive what is intended.

even though they agree with the end,
So when it comes to form,

It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ...
It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

Since they were exclusively profitable, they say: ‘This is the annihilation, eradication, and obliteration of an existing being’ when their body breaks up, after death, they say that this self exists after death.’

He eradicates the doctrines of others, and helds the others who teach the Continue, too, in the next lifetime in the next life.
