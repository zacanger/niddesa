"It is true that he is happy": ""It is true", this is the decisive language, the
undoubted language, the confident language, the undoubtedly reciting language,

wants, whoever accepts, whoever hopes, whoever desires, whoever prays, for form,
or sound, or smell, or taste, or touch." Those who will die, getting what they

2. If you are the one who desires: affection for those desires arisen,
If those desires decay (decline), you will suffer as if shot through by an arrow.

destroyed by the wrong, or caused by the prodigal in the family (??), where the
wealth is scattered or destroyed; it is [these] eight impermanence states, this
is the decay, decline, loss, fall, disappearance, brokenness of those desires.
How is he declining from all desires? When he retains that wealth, he died and
was destroyed, so he declines from those desires, Fading, losing, declining,
disappearing, broken.

"The thieves and kings take it away, the fire burns and destroys,

After the wise ones know this, they should be used and given,
After giving and receiving as its power (??), it will go to the heavens without
fault. [SN.1.41] "" Those who want to decline.

"He is suffering as if he is shot through the ground by an arrow": "If he is
shot through by an arrow made of iron, or an arrow made of bone, or an arrow
made of teeth, or an arrow made of horns, or shot through a wooden arrow, he is
annoyed, angered, persecuted, troubled, and becomes a sick person and a
sorrower. In the same way, the change and variation of the desire of things gave

arose to be restrained by (to restrain??) individuals, such as burrowing animals
lying in caves; aquatic animals lying in water; forest animals lying in the
forest; arboreal animals lying in trees. In the same way, these evil and
unwholesome dhammas give rise to mutual dependence. This is the danger of
"living there".

This was said by the Blessed One: [SN.35.151]

"Bhikkhus! Bhikkhus with apprentices and masters live in distress and
uneasiness. And, bhikkhus! How do monks with apprentices and masters live in
misery and uneasiness? (After seeing with the eyes,) giving birth to the
memories and intentions of the evil and unwholesome dhammas that follow the
knot. "They live in him; the evil and evil dhammas inhabit and enter (occupy)."
Therefore, he is called "having disciples." "They conquer him; Evil and
unwholesome dhammas conquer him." Therefore, he is called "master".

Besides, Bhikkhus! After listening to the sound with the ear..., after smelling
the smell with the nose..., after tasting the taste with the tongue..., touching
the touch with the body..., after knowing the Dhamma with consciousness, ....
Bhikkhus! In this way, monks with disciples and masters live in misery and
restlessness. "This is also the danger of "living there".

This was said by the Blessed One [It.88]: "Monks! There are these three types of
internal grime, internal non-friends, internal enemies, internal killers, and
internal grievances. Bhikkhus! Greed is internal grime, internal non-friends,
...; Monks! Sorrow...; Monks! Infatuation.... Bhikkhus! These are the three
types of internal grime, internal non-friends, internal enemies, internal
killers, and internal grievances. "

"Greed is the cause of no benefit, and greed is the one which shakes the heart,
Horror arises from it, and people don't realize (understand) it.
The greedy person does not know the benefits, the greedy person cannot see the Dhamma,
At that time he was a blind dark one: anyone who can conquer with greed.
Anger is the cause of no benefit, anger is the one that shakes the heart,
horror arises from it, and people don't realize it.
The angry do not know the benefits, the angry cannot see the Dhamma,
At that time he was a blind dark one: a man who can (be??) conquer(ed).
Foolishness is the cause of no benefit, foolishness is the one that shakes the heart,
horror arises from it, and people don't realize it.
Fools don't know the benefits, fools can't see the Dhamma,
At that time he was a blind dark one: anyone who can be conquered."
Like this it is the danger of "living there".

This was said by the Blessed One [SN.3.2]: "King! When the three dhammas within
a man arise, disadvantage, suffering, and restlessness arise. Which three are
there? King! When the greed within the man himself arises, disadvantages,
sufferings, and restlessness arise; lord! When the aggression within the man
himself arises.... King! When the foolishness within the man arises, ...."

"Greed, aversion, foolishness, disgusting (malevolent??) man,
hurt oneself, like many fruits [damage] tree('s) heart. "
This is also "inhabiting there" in danger.

This was said by the Blessed One: [SN.10.3]
"From here, there are greed and anger, from here unhappiness, happiness, and
    body hair stand up (fear??).
Arises from here and then seeks intentionally (??), like a little boy letting a crow go. "
This is also the danger of "living there".

"Distresses crush him": "Those distresses conquer, defeat, overwhelm, end, and
crush that person." Him, crushed by dangers.

"After, suffering follows him": ""After", adversity follows the person; life
follows the person; age follows..., sickness follows..., ...death..., sorrow,
despair, the suffering of hell, the suffering of the animal world, the suffering
of the hungry ghost world, human suffering...; rooted in the suffering of
entering the womb..., rooted in the suffering of the mother's womb, the
suffering of the bond of birth, the birth, the suffering placed by others, the
suffering that oneself brings, the suffering of others' persecution...; eye
diseases, ear diseases, ..., and the pain of contact with the fly mosquito, the
sun, and the snake, ...; the pain of losing the mother, the father, brother,
sister, losing a son, a daughter, family loss, property loss, loss from disease,
virtue loss, sight loss...." Suffering follows him afterwards.

"As water is to a broken ship": "As a broken ship is in the water, from there
the water follows, accompanies, and becomes a follower; from the front, the
water follows, accompanies, and becomes a follower; from behind..., from
below..., from the side.... In the same way, from the distress to follow, follow
the person, become a follower; live with suffering, follow, follow, become a
follower... (omitted)." Like water to a broken ship.

6. Therefore people who are always mindful, and can avoid all desires,
can ride through the storm after breaking off these, like drawing out the
water from the ship and reaching the other shore.

"Therefore, a person always mindful": "Therefore", "Therefore; the reason; the
cause; the condition; the cause, when you see this fault on the desires." The
reason. "Person", .... "Always", always; everything; all the time; constant;

middle age, and old age. "Mindful", ...." A mindful person.

"Can avoid all desires": "Desire", .... "Can avoid all desires", "can avoid all

things, after abandoning the desire for pollution, after abandoning, after being
driven away, after finishing, and making it come to non-existence; after the
desire of desire is covered with abandonment, after abandonment, after eviction,
after the end, and after making it go to non-existence; the cover of malice...,
the cover of sleepiness..., cover of demotion and regret..., the cover of
suspicion..., ...after making it non-existent, the storm of desire, some storms,
the storm of seeing, the storm of ignorance, he can ride through, surpass, pass,
surmount, and overcome." He can ride through the storm having cut those off.

"As you draw (water) out (from) a ship and become a person who reaches the other
shore": As a heavy ship with a load is drawn out, emptied, and discharged into a
light ship, it can go to the other shore quickly and easily. In the same way,
after he knows the desire for things, after he has given up on the desire for
pollution, ..., ...after making it go to non-existence, can go to the other side
quickly and easily. The other side is called immortality, Nibbāna, that is the
cessation of all actions, the cessation of all attachments, the cessation of
craving, greed, extinction, and Nibbāna. "Can go to the other shore", can reach
the other shore; can arrive at the other shore; can testify to the other shore.
"Anyone who has reached the other shore", whoever wants to go to the other
shore, he is the one who has reached the other shore; whoever goes to the other
shore, he is also the one who has reached the other shore; whoever has reached
the other shore, he is also the one who has reached the other shore.

This was said by the Blessed One: [SN.35.238]

"I have crossed to the other shore, and the Brahmin is standing on the high
ground." "Monks! "Brahman" is a synonym for an Arahant." He has proven to reach
the other shore; those on the other shore; those who have reached the other
shore through practice; ...by testifying; ...by the knowledge of all dhammas;
...by the knowledge of all suffering; ...by abandoning all pollution; ...by the
practice of the Four Holy Paths; those who testify of destruction reach the
other shore; the one who waits until reaching the other shore, he is the free
reacher in the holy ring (??), the highest (paramita) arrival; free in the holy
determination (sanctuary??) he is the one who has reached the other side; at the
sanctity of the confines (??), the highest arrival; at the holy liberation, the

the end; ...the boundary (ultimate); ...the terminator; ...the rescue; ...the
refuge; ...the shelter; ...no terror; ...no death; ...undeath; ...the person who
has reached undeath, has reached Nibbāna. The person who has reached Nibbāna, he

decayed, who have no turbid intentions, ...have calmed their lives,
...are kind and free, are liberated in wisdom, the
highest person, the supreme person, who has achieved the supreme accomplishment,
neither composes nor disassembles, does not accumulate and then stands (??); neither
gives up nor clings, but stands after giving up;
neither dispelling nor does not accumulate, and staying after dispersing(??
"neither dissipates nor performs, and does not disperse"??);

neither extinguishing nor lighting, staying standing after extinguishing
[SN.22.79], is a state of no learning precepts (??), the abiding person..., the
no-learning singularity..., the no-learning wisdom..., the no-learning
liberation aggregator..., the inhabitants who have the state of the no-learning
liberation of the wisdom perception, the inhabitants who have completed and
penetrated reality, those who have passed the disturbance (craze), those who are
standing after the pollution fire is extinguished, those who are no longer
coming at all, those who have grasped victory, and those who have been freed

This is the one who reaches the other shore after drawing out the boat.
