### 18. Explanation of reciting verses on the other side

(instructions for the recitation of the verses of the other side path)

102. [Venerable Binchia like this:] I will recite the other side road, if he
     sees it like this, he tells: the flawed men, the vast wise one,
Desire, a desireless forest dragon elephant, why would he say vainly?

"I'm going to recite the other side road": "I'm going to recite what's been
recited, I'm going to recite what's been told along with the narration, I'm
going to talk about what's been talked about, I am going to say what has been
said." I am going to chant the other side road.

"[Like this Venerable Binqiya]": ...(omitted, see previous sections).

"If he sees like this, he speaks": "If he sees like this, he tells, explains,
teaches, informs, establishes, uncovers, analyzes, and clarifies: "All actions
are impermanent" as he sees like this.... "All actions are suffering".... "All
dhammas are selfless".... "Every collection of dhamma is extinguishing dhamma"
...." As sees like this he tells.

"The flawed men, the vastly wise one": "The flawed, greed is a flaw, hatred...,
ignorance, anger, resentment, all unwholesome deeds, and flaws, for the Buddha
and the Blessed One, have been cut off, and the roots have been cut off, just
like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent, something immortal for
the future. The Buddha is the defouler, the descaler, the one who has abandoned
the flaws, the one who has been freed from the flaws, the one who has overcome
all the flaws. The earth is called wide....Therefore, the Buddha is extremely
wise.

"Desire-free, desireless forest dragon elephant": "Desire", "There are two kinds
of desires.... The Blessed One does not desire in desire.... "Those who are free
from desire.

"For those who have no desire for forests (??)", greed is desire for forests;
hatred... It is said that it has been cut off, and the root has been cut off....
Therefore, the Buddha is a person who has no desire to forest.... "The one who
has no desire. "Dragon Elephant", .... "A free-spirited, non-desiring dragon
elephant.

"For what reason will he say falsely": ""For what reason", "For what reason?
What is the cause? What is the reason? What is the cause? What is the
condition?" For what reason. "Speaking falsely" means speaking, telling,
explaining, and saying falsely. "Speaking falsely", to speak falsehood; to speak
non-sacred words: here, a certain type of people go to the synagogue or to the
assembly, or to the relatives, or to the group, or to the palace, brought as a
witness to question: "Hey! Come! Man! Please tell me what you know of the way.
He said without knowing: "I know". Or, if he knew it, he said: "I don't know".
He didn't see it and said, "I see". Or, when he saw it, he said, "I didn't see
it.. "Like this, he deliberately said vainly based on his own cause, or the
cause of others, or because of a little temptation. This is called false speech.

Or, use three behaviors as 'liars': just before [saying] [thinking]: "I will
say lies. "When said, [thinking]: "I'm speaking lies. When I have said it,
[thinking]: "I have said the lies. Take these three behaviors as lies. Or, use
the four behaviors: just before [saying], [thinking]: "I will say a liar. "When
I said, [thinking]: "I'm talking as liar. When I have said it [thinking]: "I
have said the lies. "There are opinions of different attachments (errors), and
these four behaviors are regarded as lie. Or, take five forms... six forms...
seven forms... eight forms are lie: Before saying... There are (wrong) opinions
of different attachments, the likes of different attachments, the hobbies of
different attachments, the desires of different attachments, and the nature of
different attachments. These eight behaviors are regarded as lies and false
words. For what reason will one vainly speak, tell, explain, and speak. "Why do
you say vainly?

103. (Of??) Those who have given up their ignorance and foulness, to those who
    have given up on sloth and hiding of evil,
Come on! I will tell, with beautiful words.

Belonging to those who have given up on ignorance and foulness": "'Foulness',
greed..., anger.., ignorance..., sloth..., seeing..., pollution..., all evil
deeds are foulness; The kamma is dirt.

"Ignorance", the ignorance of suffering.... For the Buddha and the Blessed One,
ignorance and foulness have been cut off.... Therefore, the Buddha is the one
who has renounced ignorance and foulness. "Belonging to those who have given up
on ignorance and foulness.

"To those who renounce conceit and hide evil": ""Conceit", one is conceited:
that is the height of the heart; two kinds...: self praise is conceited,
contempt for others is conceited; three: "I am the winner"..., "I am the same",
"I am the inferior"; four: to gain, to have fame, use praise, and music (??);
five: "I do get the desired form", "I do get the desired sound", smell...

winner thinks: "I am the inferior"...; and equal think: "I am the winner", the
equal thinks: "I am the same", the equal thinks: "I am the inferior", the
inferior thinks: "I am the winner", the inferior thinks: "I am the same", the
inferior thinks: "I am the inferior"; there are ten kinds...: here, by certain
birth, or surname, or good family, or beauty as a lotus, or property, or
research (acquisition), or career, or craftsmanship, or Ming (??) (academic), or
by what you hear, or by arguing, or by something to make it conceited; anyone
who, like this, kind of heart conceit, thinks, perceives the situation, tribute
high (??), high conceit, banner, high, heart vanity is called conceited.

"Hiding evil", the act of hiding evil, hypocrisy, envy, jealous behavior, this
is called hiding evil. For the Buddha and the Blessed One, the conceit and the
hiding of evil have been cut off.... Therefore, the Buddha is a person who
abandons conceit and hiding of evil. "Those who renounce conceit and hiding of
evil.

"Come on! I will talk with beautiful words": ""Come on", the continuation of
sentences; the connection of sentences; the completion of sentences; the
combination of words; the connection of words and sentences; this is the order
of the sentence, which is "Come on". I will speak with beautiful words", reach
(have), arrive (have), enter, fully enter, have enough, sufficient, have
beautiful words, language, ways (??), and speech, I will tell, teach, build,
uncover, parse, and clarify." Come on! I will tell beautiful words.

104. Dispelling the dark, enlightened, and all eyes, those who have reached the edge of
    the world, surpass all the others,
Those who have no troubles, give up all suffering, those who are truly called,
Brahmins! Be served by me.

"Dispelling the dark, enlightened, and all eyes": ""Dispelling the dark", the
darkness of greed, the darkness of aversion, ...ignorance, ...sloth...,
seeing..., pollution..., ...evil, blindly doing, do not make (wisdom) eyes, do
not make wisdom and the wisdom of the destroyer, annoying companions, do not
lead to Nibbāna to exclude, remove, abandon, drive away, end, and make it go to
non-existence.", "That is the Blessed One...." All eyes are called the state of
all knowing wisdom...." Dispelling the dark, the Buddha, all those who see (who
sees all??).

"Those who have reached the edge of the world, surpassing all others": ""World",
one world: some worlds; Two worlds: some worlds and the arising world(s??); what
has become into the world and what arises becomes the world; there is the world
of degeneration and the degeneration of the arising of the world. Three worlds:
three feelings. Four worlds: four foods (??). Five worlds: five accumulations.
Six worlds: six inner worlds. Seven worlds: seven consciousness dwellings. Eight
worlds: eight worlds (??). Nine worlds: where the nine living beings live. Ten
worlds: ten places. Twelve worlds: twelve places. Eighteen worlds: eighteen
worlds. "Those who have reached the edge of the world", "The Lord is the one who
has reached the edge of the world; has reached the end; ...reached the Nibbāna;
arrived at the Nibbāna, ...descended into the state, ...practiced ...the cycle
of life and death, without his rebirth." Those who have reached the edge of the
world.

"Beyond all beings", there are two types of "beyond all": in kamma and rebirth.
What is kamma? Blessed deeds, non-blessed deeds, and immovable deeds are kamma.
What is rebirth? The forms, feelings, thoughts, behaviors and consciousness of
the knot are ribirth. The Blessed One is the transcended one, the one who has
passed through, and the one who has overcome. "Those who have reached the edge
of the world and surpass all others

"Those who have no worries (troubles), those who give up all suffering": "There
are four kinds of worries in "worries": worries of desire, worries of some,
worries of seeing, worries of ignorance. Those worries have been given up by the
Buddha and the Blessed One, cut off, ..., so the Buddha is a trouble-free
person. "To cut off all suffering", to him, everything belongs to the
reproductive life, suffering, old age suffering, sickness, death, sorrow, grief,
despair...,  the suffering of decay has been cut off, cooled, calmed down,
stopped, unable to arise, and burned by the fire of wisdom. The Buddha is the
one who gives up all suffering." The one who has no troubles and gives up all
suffering.

"True addresser (truly called??), Brahmin! Be served by me": "True addresser",
"True addresser, equivalent name, equivalent addresser, true equivalent
addressee, Vai Po Shizun, Shiqi Shizun, Visheva Shizun, Kulou Sunshizun,
Kunnahan Shizun, and Kassapa, those Buddhas and Shizun (??) are those who have
the same name and the same address, and Sakyamuni also belongs to those Buddhas,
and the Blessed One is the same name and those who are the same name." So the
Buddha is the real caller (name??).

"Brahmin! Be served by me": "The Blessed One is trusted, served, respected by
me, asking questions all the time." Brahman! Served by me.

105. For example, a bird will live in a fruity forest after abandoning a small
     forest,
After I abandon all the rare things like this, like a goose which has reached the
great lake.

"For example, after a bird abandons a small forest, it will live in a fruity
forest": ""A bird (twice born) is called a bird (winged). Why is a bird born
twice called winged? "Born twice" is born twice: "From mother's uterus and the
egg shell, born twice for this reason, so are called winged. "A bird (born
twice). "Like after abandoning a small forest", like a bird, a small mountain
forest with little fruit, food, and water. After abandoning, after going beyond,
after passing, after leaving, you will get, find, and obtain other fruits, large
forests and dense forests with lots of food and plenty of water, will build
shelter in that dense forest. The bird, After abandoning the grove, bird, will
live in the fruity forest.

"Like this, after I abandon the rare ones, it is as if the geese have reached
the great lake": ""Like this" is a metaphorical arrangement. "After abandoning
the rare ones", Bāvari Brahman and other his Asari compare with the Buddha and
Blessed One, those who are rare, insignificant, inferior, lesser, little-seen,
lower, non-supreme, inferior; after abandoning, after leaving, surpassing,
passing, and transcending, the best-seen one obtains, finds, and gets the
Buddha, the world-honored person: the immeasurable seer, the top seer, the
unequal, the unparalleled, the uncontrasted, incomparable, heaven in the sky,
bull king among men, lion among men, dragon elephant among men, virtuous men
bull with strong endurance among men, holder of ten powers. For example, the
geese will get, find, and obtain the big man-made or the immortal pool, or the
unshakable and immeasurable water accumulation of the sea lake. Similarly, the
Buddha and the Blessed One are the unshakable ones. Those with infinite
brilliance, those who have developed wisdom, ...have discerning eyes, ...are
clever, have proven to be unobstructed, have reached the four fearless ones,
have pure aspirations, are lonely and white (??), do not talk, claim to be like
that, are not small, are great, are deep, cannot be measured, are difficult to
penetrate, have vast treasures, are equal to the ocean, have six peaces, are
incomparable, are vast, and those who cannot be measured; he is the speaker like
that, the speaker of the Path, like Mount Sumi (Sumeru??) in the mountains, like
the gold-winged bird among the birds, like the lion among the beasts, like the
river reaching the sea, he is the master, the winner, the top one, and the great
immortal. "After I abandon the rare ones for this, like the goose has reached
the great lake.

106. Whatever they told me before, before Gotama's teaching: like this that was
     once, like this and that will be,
That's all rumors, all that is an increase in theory.

"What they told me before": ""What", Bāvari Brahman and his other Asari (??),
they explain, teach... their own views, likes, hobbies, opinions, intentions."
They told me before.

"Before the teachings of Gotama": "Before the teachings of Gotama, on the other
side of the teachings of Gotama; before the commandments of Gotama, the Buddha's
precepts, the precepts of the victors, the precepts of the Tathāgata, the first
precepts of the Arahants." Before the precepts of Gotama.

"Like this and that was, like this and that will be": ...(omitted, see previous
sections).

"It's all rumors": ....

"That is all the increase in theory": ....

107. Alone, the dark disperser, the one seated one, he is the shining one, the author of
     light,
The Blessed One is a wise man, and the Blessed One is a broadly wise man.

"The one who is alone, the one who disperses the darkness, and the one who sits
down": ""One who is alone", the Blessed One is alone in the name of a monk, with
no partner for righteousness as alone, with thirst for righteousness as alone,
and "always free from greed , "always distracting(??)" means alone, always
deprecated(??)" means alone, "always no pollution" means alone, "crossing the
road without a fork" is alone, and "has already realized the highest
enlightenment" as alone.

How is the Blessed One alone in the name of a monk? When the Blessed One was
young, the black-haired youth possessed the happiness of youth. At the beginning
of life, even if the parents didn't want, tearful, crying, and sighing, they
still abandon their relatives, cut off all obstacles in the home, and cut off
the barrier of their children and wife, ...family, ...friend, ...storage (??),
shave hair and put on robes, go out from home, being a monk in a non-domestic
life, into a state of no possessions, then walk alone, live, act, turn around,
guard, and survive. "In this way, the Blessed One is alone in the name of a
monk.

How is the Blessed One alone without a partner? "When he was such a monk, he was
alone in the woods, wild forests, and border dwellings (sitting places): quiet,
away from the atmosphere, living alone, suitable for sitting alone; he would
walk alone, stand alone, sit alone, lie alone, enter the village alone for alms,
go forward alone, return alone, sit alone in a quiet place, perform alone, live,
move, turn, guard, and survive alone. "In this way, the Blessed One is  alone
without a partner.

How is the Blessed One alone with the disruption of thirsting love? He is so
alone and without a partner, when he lived in reluctance, zealous, and
self-effort. Under the Bodhi tree by the Nilian Chan River (??), with diligence
and effort, destroying the devil (Mara) accompanied by the army, the evil demon, and
the relatives of the liberated (relaxed??); afterwards, the netted, strong flowing,
entangled thirsty loves, he abandoned, drove away, ended, and made to go to
no-existence.

"People who have thirsty love as their partner, reincarnate for a long time,
become such a state, other states, do not go beyond reincarnation.
Knowing this kind of trouble: craving is the origin of suffering,
Departing from thirsty love, no taking, bhikkhus should march conscientiously.
"[It.15/Sn.3.12,745-746]

This is the Blessed One who is alone with the thirsty home.

How can the Blessed One be alone with "always away from greed"? "Take one of the
states of greed to renounce greed(??)" as aloneness, "to renounce one of the
angered states of renunciation(??)" as loneliness, "use one of the maddening
states of renunciation, to liberate" as independence, "to taint one of the
disconnected states of "no pollution" aloneness. In this way, the Blessed One is
alone with "always free from greed".

How is the Blessed One one who "has passed the road without a fork" as alone?
The road without forks is called the Four Mindfulness... (omitted) Eight Sacred
Paths.

"The one who sees the death of life, the one who has mercy (pity??),
    knows the way without forks,
Used this way to cross the storm in the past, and they will be and present (??)."
[SN.47.18]

This is the way the Blessed One "has passed the road without fork" as alone.

How is the Blessed One's "Single Enlightenment" being alone? Enlightenment is
called wisdom, root of wisdom, power of wisdom, enlightenment of choice,
investigation, vipassana, right view on the four realms. The Blessed One
realized that "all actions are impermanent", ..."every collection of dhammas is
extinguished." Or, everything that should be felt, should be conscious, should
be awakened, should be enlightened, should be realized, should be touched,
should be testified, everything is conscious of that consciousness, awakening,
enlightenment, attainment, reaching, testifying. In this way, the Blessed One is
alone.

"Dispelling the Darkness", .... "Sitting down", "The Blessed One is sitting at
the  Bosha Gota Temple." Seated.

"When Muni was sitting on the hillside, he had reached the other side of
suffering,
And the disciples served, and Sanming's (??) death deceased. [SN.8.10]"

This is also the one who sits down. Or, "In the state where all efforts have
ceased, the Blessed One is the one who sits, the one who has descended, and the
one who has practiced...." This is also the one who sits down. "For the alone,
the dark disperser, and the one sitting down.

"He is the shining person, the author of the light": "The shining person is the
wise, supremely wise, enlightened, distinguished, and wise. "The luminous
author", Author of light, illuminator, bringer of light." The shining, the
author of light.

"Blessed One is the one who is broadly wise": "Blessed One is the one who
symbolizes the vastness, Wisdom is the symbol, Wisdom is the flag (??), Wisdom
is the marker, Wisdom is increased, the multi-selection, the simpler (??), the
more deliberate, the fully deliberate nature, the one who lives in the
understanding, the character, the more, the heavy (??), the object of that, the
harder, the lean, the winner, and the better.

"The flag is the sign of the chariot, the smoke is the sign of the fire,
The king is the symbol of the country, and the husband is the symbol of the woman.
[SN.1.72]"

In the same way, Blessed One is the symbol of the vastness (the broad wisdom),
the wisdom as the symbol, the wisdom as the banner, the wisdom as the flag, and
the wisdom as the increase. For those who understand, those who have character,
...who have more, who value the other, who target that, who work hard, ...lean
toward that, overcome the solution, improve, have more character, emphasize the
other, take that as the object, work hard, lean toward the one who overcomes,
the one who increases. "Blessed One is a wise man.

"Guotama is the vast wise man": "The earth is called broad.... Therefore, the
Buddha is an extremely intelligent person".

108. The one who taught me the Dhamma: directly visible, immediate,
the extinction of thirst, the disaster-free, there is no metaphor for that no
matter where.

"The one who teaches me the Dhamma": ""The one", that is the one who is the
world-honored person, the solo person, and the one without a teacher who has
realized the truth in the Dhamma that has not been heard before, and reaches the
state of all knowing there. One who is in a state of freedom in strength.
"Teaching the Dhamma", "Dhamma", the beginning is good...; he explained, taught,
informed, established, uncovered, analyzed, clarified, and explained." He taught
the Dhamma for me.

"Directly visible, immediate": ""Directly visible, immediate, you are invited to
meet, guided, and the wise should experience it for himself." This is directly
visible. Or, "He practices the eight sacred paths, he realizes that way
indiscriminately and immediately, and he finds and obtains results." This is
also 'directly visible'. "Immediate", such as after people give money to them at
a certain time, they are indiscriminately obtained(??), they waited for time.
The Dhamma is indeed not this. Anyone who is practising the Eight Noble Paths in
his life will realize that path indiscriminately and immediately. He finds and
obtains the Fruit, not elsewhere (the next life), not in the other world (the
next life), this is instant." Directly visible and instant.

"Extinction of thirst, no disaster": ""Thirst for love", the thirst for form....
"Extinction of thirst", extinction of thirst, ...of greed, of hatred,
...delusion, interest, past rebirth, knot of rebirth, some, reincarnation,
rotation. "No disaster", pollution and formation are called disasters, the
renunciation of catastrophes, the cessation of catastrophes, the disruption of
catastrophes, the discontinuation of catastrophes, immortality, and Nibbāna."
The extinction of craving and no disaster.

"For that, there is no metaphor no matter where it is": ""For that", for
Nibbāna. "There is no metaphor", there is no metaphor, no comparison, no
equivalent, no similarity, it does not exist, not to be known, not to be
discovered. "No matter where," no matter where, where, somewhere, inside or
outside of oneself, or inside and outside." For that, there is no metaphor no
matter where.

109. Why did you leave from that person, Binchia! Even for a moment:
From the broad wisdom of the Blessed One, from the broad wisdom of the Blessed One?

"Why did you leave from that place?": "Why did you leave, go, and leave from the
Buddha." Why did you leave from that place.

"Binchia! Even for a moment": "Even a moment, even an instant even part (of??)
time, even for half a day. "For even a moment. "Binchia," Bāvari called that
junior by his name.

"From the Blessed One, the broadly wise": "From the Blessed One's vastness as
the symbol ...." From the wisdom of Gotama.

"From the vast wise man of Gotama": "The earth is called vast....

110. He teaches you the Dhamma: directly visible, immediate,

matter where.

"He teaches the Dhamma for you": ....

From the Blessed One with the broad wisdom, from the Buddha the vastly wise.

"I didn't live away from that person": "I didn't live away from the Buddha,
leave, be apart." I didn't live away from that person.

"Brahmin! Even for a moment": "Even for a moment...." "Brahmin", he respectfully
calls his uncle.

"From the Blessed One, the broadly wise": ....

"From the vast wise man of Gotama": "The earth is called vast....

112. The one who taught me the Dhamma: directly visible, immediate,

matter where.

"The one who teaches the Dhamma for me": ....

"For that, there is no metaphor no matter where it is": ....

113. I saw him like my eyes(??), Brahman! Day and night,
I spend the night in salute, just (??) because of that I think I haven't left.

"I see him like an eye with intention": "If a man with eyes can see, look,
watch, observe, observe form, etc. in the light. In the same way, I see, look,
watch, observe with intention, observe the Buddha, the World-Honored One." I saw
him like an eye.

"Brahmin! Day and night without letting go": "During the day and night without
letting go, I practice Buddha's thoughts." Brahman! Relentless day and night.

"I spend the night in salute": ""In salute", in salute with the body, or salute
with words, or salute with the heart, or salute with the meaning, in homage, or
in obedience to the Dhamma, in respect, in salute, in reverence, I spend, pass
through day and night." For me to spend the night in salute.

"Because of that, I think there is no leaving": "When practising with that
Buddha's mindfulness, I think it is "no leaving". I think, I know that it is "no
leaving." I know so; I am so (??). I know; I don't do it like this; I know so
for sure; I know it well." Because of that, I think I haven't left.

114. Faith, joy, mind, thought, these did not depart from Gotama's
     teachings,
Where the wise person walks, I pay respect to the other person in that
direction. (Whosoever walks in the direction in which He walks, I salute him in
that direction??)

"Faith, joy, mind, thought": ""Faith", everything about faith, belief, trust,

Faith, joy, mind, and thought.

"These did not depart from the teachings of Gotama": "These four methods did not
depart from the teachings of Gotama, the Buddha, the victors, the Tathāgatas,
the Arahants; leave, disappear." These did not leave from Gotama's teachings.

"Where the wise one walks": ""Where the wise one goes": "Where the direction
is", east or west, or south or north, he walks, goes, and heads. "Bright wise
one", broad wise one is great wise one, the wise person, the quick wise person,
the discerning wise person; the earth is called broad, and the Blessed One has
the same expansive wisdom as that earth." The direction where the wise one
walks.

"I pay homage (salute) to the others in this direction (path??)": "The one who
pays homage to the Buddha's direction, the one who is directed to it (the
object??), the one who strives, the one who leans toward the one who overcomes,
the one who increases. "Because I am the one who respects others in that
direction.

115. Because of my aging and weakness, (just??) because my body didn't walk there,
I walked continuously with my thoughts, Brahman! Because my mind is united with
him.

"Because of my aging, weakness": "I am old due to aging, old age, advanced age,
and have reached old age. "Because of weakness", due to weak power, due to low
power, due to reduced power." Because of my aging, weak power.

Because my mind is united with him.

116. Lying in the mud and shaking, I floated from island to island,
Then see (saw??) the enlightened ones: those who have crossed the waterfall, those who
have no troubles.

"Lying in the mud and trembling": ""Lying in the mud", "in the mud of desire, in

living beings cross the danger zone: make them cross the danger zone of thieves,
...with beasts, ...of hunger, ...of no water, he makes it out, makes it over,
makes it pass, and makes it reach the ultimate place of stability. In the same
way, the Blessed One is the leader of the caravan and enables all living beings
to pass through dangerous zone: make them pass through the danger zone of life,
...of age, disease, death, sadness, sorrow, suffering, worry, despair, greed,
anger, foolishness, conceit, seeing, pollution, evil deeds; He crosses the dense

who has the mind to overcome.
