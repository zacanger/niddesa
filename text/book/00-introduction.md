# Introduction

The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravada Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikaya in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is a
commentary on parts of the Sutta Nipata, and is attributed to Ven. Sariputta
(Pali; Sanskrit Sariputra). There are two parts:

* The Maha Niddesa (Nd1), commentary on the Atthaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Culla Niddesa (Nd2), commentary on on the Parayana Vagga (Sn 5) and the Khaggavisana Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutra, Sn 1.3)

It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the Sutta Nipata; if not,
put this book down, find a copy of that one, read it, and come back to this one
later.

## About This Translation

There has never been a complete English language translation before.
After asking around online,
I got [an answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that pointed
me to a Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation. While it
would surely be valuable to learn Chinese, Sinhala, and Pali, that seemed like a
larger project than I wanted to take on.

So I automated translations from both the Sinhala and the Chinese using the
wonders of modern technology and a bit of code, and took these four (two sources
times two passes at translation), and wrangled them into the first English
translation. There will likely be many errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies
in this early translation. Several transliterations of the Pali are available,
and may inform future corrections and revisions.

This translation prefers Pali over Sanskrit terms (Dhamma vs. Dharma, kamma vs.
kamma, etc.), and chooses to forgo diacritics and accents, as those are both
difficult to work with in English-language software, and difficult for most
native English speakers to understand. To paraphrase Engels, changing the words
we use a bit won't change the things themselves. I have also omitted and
abbreviated stanzas which were repeated verbatim. The repetitious style is
common in the ancient sources because it was an aid for memorization and
recitation, but it is the translator's opinion that this tends to harm
readability in printed text. The reader is assumed to be able to fill in the
gaps.
