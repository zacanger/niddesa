# Introduction

The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravada Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikaya in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is a
commentary on parts of the Sutta Nipāta,
and is attributed to Venerable
Sāriputta (Pāli; Sanskrit Sariputra). There are two parts:

* The Mahā Niddesa (Nd 1), a commentary on the Atṭḥaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Cūlạ Niddesa (Nd 2), a commentary on the Pārāyana Vagga (Sn 5) and the
  Khaggavisānạ Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutta, Sn 1.3)

It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the Sutta Nipāta; if not,
put this book down, find a copy of that one, read it, and come back to this one
later.

## About This Translation

There has never been a complete English language translation before. After
asking around online, I got [an
answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that pointed me to a
Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation. While it would
surely be valuable to learn Chinese, Sinhala, and Pāli, that seemed like a
larger project than I wanted to take on.

So I automated translations from both the Sinhala and the Chinese using the
wonders of modern technology and a bit of code, and took these four (two sources
times two passes at translation), and wrangled them into the first English
translation. There will likely be many errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies
in this early translation. Several transliterations of the Pāli are available,
and may inform future corrections and revisions.

This translation prefers Pāli over Sanskrit terms (Dhamma vs. Dharma, kamma vs.
karma, etc.). To paraphrase Engels, changing the words we use a bit won't change
the things themselves. I have also omitted and abbreviated stanzas which were
repeated verbatim. The repetitious style is common in the ancient sources
because it was an aid for memorization and recitation, but does nothing (in the
translator's opinion) to improve the text when in print. This results in a
significantly shorter version than the transliterated Pāli editions.

I have also chosen to use the term 'Rhinoceros' rather than 'Rhinoceros Horn';
there is some debate about this, and maybe when I can read the Pāli I'll feel
differently, but the meaning of the sutta is the same either way (unless you're
a rhinoceros expert, maybe).
