This is the start of a possible future preface/introduction type thing.
Obviously the work is not done, I'm mostly just taking notes here.

The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravada Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikāya in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is a
commentary on parts of the Sutta Nipata, and is attributed to Sāriputta (Pali;
Sanskrit Śāriputra). There are two sections:

* The Maha Niddesa (Nd1), commentary on the Atthaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Culla Niddesa (Nd2), commentary on on the Parayana Vagga (Sn 5) and the Khaggavisana Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutra, Sn 1.3)

There has never been a complete English language translation before.
After asking around online,
I got [an answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that pointed
me to a Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation. While it
would surely be valuable to learn Chinese, Sinhala, and Pali, that seemed like a
larger project than I wanted to take on.

So I automated translations from both the Sinhala and the Chinese using the
wonders of modern technology — translation APIs from Google and Amazon and a
little bit of glue code. I took these four ((Google + Amazon) * (Sinhala +
Chinese)) translations and from them, built the first English translation. There
will likely be many errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in this early
translation. I hope to be able to learn Pali and fix any mistakes in a future
edition.
