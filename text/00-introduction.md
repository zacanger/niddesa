The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of
Theravada Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikāya in the Sutta Piṭaka. It is a
commentary on parts of the Sutta Nipata, and is attributed to Sāriputta (Pali;
Sanskrit Śāriputra). There are two sections:

* The Maha Niddesa (Nd1), commentary on the Atthaka Vagga (Sn 4)
* The Culla Niddesa (Nd2), commentary on on the Parayana Vagga (Sn 5) and the Khaggavisana Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutra, Sn 1.3)

There has never been a complete English language translation before. This
project began because I wanted to read it, and the only available options were
to learn Sinhala, Chinese, or Pali. While learning any or all of those languages
would be valuable, that seemed a larger project than I was ready to take on, so
I automated translations from both the Sinhala and the Chinese using the wonders
of modern technology and then worked with those translations to build the first
readable full English translation of both parts. There will likely be many
errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in this early translation. I hope to
be able to learn Pali and fix any mistakes in a future edition.
