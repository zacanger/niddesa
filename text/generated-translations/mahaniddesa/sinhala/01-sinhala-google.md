Is matured. He went there and went to the extreme
Went to the corner, went to the terminal, went to the terminal
The aspirant went to the end, the final aspirant went to the asylum
Achieved went to safety Safe took refuge in Sarana
Absolutely Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute
Achieved went to nectar Nectar went to Nibbana
Nibbana was the end of the rain, the end of the journey, the end of the journey
The enemy ended up going to the edge and the controlled Bambasara is the greatest
The view is that cultivated roads have vulnerable defilements unchanged
The realization is the perceived restraint that He understood the suffering.
The sea (lust) has vanished. The road grew. The quarantine was demonstrated.
Data was known. What needs to be captured was captured. What needs more
Cultivated. What needs to be proven was proven.

[APZ 6.20] (# apz6.20) {# apz6.20 .ref .apz දොර The door he raised has locks, closed
The moat is there, the door is locked, there is no lock, it was Aryan, it was locked
The flags are there, the weight is off, the wall is free, the elements are paid, the elements
Consisting of six, there is a single defense, four drawn, various distances removed
Yes, those who are sympathetic are looking for, those who have undisturbed thoughts, in the calm body
Have a good heart, have a well-frozen mind, have a well-frozen wisdom,
When the rain came the nobleman came, the absolute man was the noblest man
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person. Was destroyed.
It does not go away. Not strictly. Is far away. It is not seamless.
The smoke did not separate it from the flies. Smoke does not spread. Smoke
The spread was of unruly silly stalks. Non-disciplined Samadhi
Had stalks. Disciplined was the trunk of wisdom. Not to discipline
Was composed of free stems. From the part of free intellect that is not disciplined
Was fitted. Knew the truth. The lust was over. Extinguish the fire of filth
Was. Roundabout pDid not exist. How, admitted. Redemption
Was in association. Maitreya was clean. Please
Muditha was eating clean from the neglect. In the utmost purity
Was. There was a cleanliness that was not done by anything. The frozen heart was happy
Was in the mind. There was a corner of the body, there was a corner of motion. The end of birth
Was. (Eyes etc.) were at the ends of the relics. (Eye etc.) was at the end of the place.
The pregnancy was over. Sasara was at the end. (Sasara) was at the end of the fence.
Was in the latter state. Was in the last body. Arahants holding the last two
The Lord. His western end body, birth and death, behavior,
He has no rebirth, "heals again and goes away".
