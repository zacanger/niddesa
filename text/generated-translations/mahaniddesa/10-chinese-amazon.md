10. Description of the pre-disintegration
 Secondly, the description of the Bible before the collapse will say:
 83. What kind of rings of viewers is called the "silent"?
 Joe Tama! Please tell me about it, the most person being asked about.
 "What kind of bearer ring is called the "silence": "What kind of sight", "What kind of sight, what kind of estates, what kind, what kind, what kind of contrast saw." For what kind of viewer. "What kind of ring", "what kind of ring, what kind of ring, what kind of contrasting ring." What kind of rings for what kind of viewer. "Known as the "Silent", "is called, spoken, talked, spoken, spoken, spoken, spoken, spoken, said to be silent, silent, quiet down, cooler, and stop." "What kind of viewers" adds a glamorous to the inquiry; "What ring" adds a ring to the inquiry, and the "Silent" hears heart for the inquiry. What kind of ring is called the "Silent" for what kind of viewer?
 "Joe Tama! Tell me about it": "That, whosoever I inquire; whosoever I beg; whosoever I ask, and whosoever makes me clear. "Joe Tamo," the man named Buddha and Worldin by his name.

 Because then, the man said:
 "What kind of rings of the Seeing is called the Silent?
 Joe Tama! Please tell me about it, the best person being asked about."
 84. [Like this worldly:] before the collapse of his thirst for the love, not relying on the forefront,
 What is not supposed to be counted in the middle is not valued for him.
 "before the collapse of the thirst": "before the body collapses; before the collapse of the body; before the body is forsaken; before the body is forsaken; the unthirsty, the one who has forsaken, the one who has forsaken, has forsaken the thirst, And those who have freed from their thirst, have forsaken their love, those who have lost their thirst, have gone away from greedy, no greedy, the one who has ruled out greed, freed from greed, the one who has dismissed the greedy, the one who is not hungry, And the cooled, he that has become cool, and feel joy, dweld himself for the bereaved of his family.
 "Worldworld", synonyms of respect. In addition, the "corrupt" is worldly; "destroyed" is worldly; "spoilt the slower" is worldly; "destroyed the slower" is worldly; "destroyed" is worldly; "has destroyed the thorns" for Worldship; "Destroy the polluter" for worldship; "division, analysis, distinction" for worldship; "some end" for worldship; "have been practiced, the heart has been practiced, the heart has been practiced, Hui has been practiced" for worldship ; or "Worldmaster close to the forest, wilderness, edge dwelling (sitting place): less voice, quiet, away atmosphere, person alone, suitable for sitting alone"; or 'Worldship is clothes, feeding, dwellings, The patient's needs, medical necessities are worldly; or "Worldworld is the meaning, flavor, relief, increase the ring, increase the heart, increase the whims, add the heart, increase the whimsiness"; or "Worldzou is four kinds of Zen, four infinite amount „ÄÅFour colorless to the point of world'; or "Worldworld is eight relief, eight wins, nine times the first place to have points" for worldly; or "Worldworld is ten Hui [ten want?] The practice, ten times to, from the mind to the mind, not net to the points" for worldship; or "Worldship is four, four positive, four gods, five, five forces, seven feeds, seven senses, eight sacred paths." Worldplace; or "Worldworld is a part of ten such power, four fearless, four unobstructed solutions, six god, six senses." Worldworld, this name is not given by the mother; not given by the father; given by a non-brother; given by a non-sister; given by a non-friend; not his relatives; not by Salmon and Brahmen; Unheavenly This is the relief of the Buddha, worldly, and under the linden tree, and the acquisition and testimony of all wisdom and wisdom, that is, Worldom. For [Worldly like this:] for those who have quenched thirst before disintegration.
 "Not on the forefront": foreground is called the past, thirst love about the past has been cut off, see the state of percepted, to the state of thirst has been cut off, see the state that has been dismissed, so does not depend on the foreground. In addition, "I died like this"The color" is there not looking for joy [MN.132]; I passed there was such a subject... I died had such a thought... I died had such a line... "I died had such a knowledge" where not Find (guide) joy, so that it does not depend on the forefront. In addition, "My eyes used to be like that, and the color is like that." There, knowledge is not bound by desire; when it is bound by it, it does not rejoice it; and when it does not rejoice it, then does not depend on the forefront. "My ears used to be like that, and the sound was like that." ... (Slightly) "My nose used to be like that, and the smell was like that." ... "My tongue used to be like that, and the taste was like that." ... "My body was past like that, and touched it was like that." ... "My intention was past like that, and the law is like that." There, knowledge is not bound by desire; when it is bound by it, it does not rejoice it; and when not rejoicing it [MN.133], it does not depend on the forefront. Or, whoever used to laugh, speak, and play with a woman, is unhappy about it, does not want it, and does not come to happiness because of it [AN.7.50], so it does not depend on foreground.
 "In the middle is not supposed to be counted": "Middle is called the present time, the thirst about the present has been cut off, see the state that has been dismissed, to thirst has been cut off, see the state of dismissed, see the state of conception, should not be counted As a 'dye', it should not be counted as a "disgusting person," should not be counted as a "foolish", should not be counted as a "bondage", should not be counted as a 'execurer' "Come to the scattered" should not be counted as "came to the unconsensual", should not be counted as "came to the fortitude", those works (making) have been cut off, when the works (making) have been cut off, should not Counted to interest: "Fallen Hell" or "Fallen Beast," or "Devil Hunger", or "Man", or "Heaven", or "Colourless", or "Thinking", or "Unwanted" "or 'Neither the thinker nor the unwittant' who has no cause, no fate, no factor will fall into." For that in the middle should not be counted.
 "What is not valued for him": "For him", for Arrohan; for those who have been exhausted. "Being valued", there are two kinds of importance: [because] the importance of love and [because] see... (medium) This is the importance of thirsty love... (medium) This is the attention of see. For him the attention of thirsty love has been cut off, the attention of seeing has been dismissed, the state of the attention of thirsty love has been cut off, and the attention of the see has been dismissed, he does not put (do) thirsty love or see in the front and back, Thirst love is not for the flag, thirst love is not for building, thirst love is not increased, see not for the flag, see not for the building, see not to be increased, not to be thirsty love or see follow, so is not valued for him. In addition, "I will have such a color" where I do not look for joy; there will be such a subject... there will be such a thought... there will be such a line... "My future world will have such knowledge" where I do not look for ( Guidance) rejoice, so that it is also not valued for him. In addition, "My eyes will be like that in the future, and the color is like that." I do not hope for the acquisition of the heart, because of the lack of hope of the heart, do not rejoice it; when dislike it, it is also not valued for him. "My ears will come like that, and the sound is like that." ... "My nose will be like that in the future, and the smell is like that." ... "My tongue will be like that in the future, and the taste is like that." ... "My future will be like that, and the touch is like that." ... "My future is like that, and the law is like that." I do not hope for the acquisition of the heart, because of the lack of hope of the heart, do not rejoice it; when dislike it, it is also not valued for him. In addition, "I will become heavens, or one of the heavens with this forbidden, and in bitterness. [MN.16]" Do not hope for unobtained acquisition, because of the lack of hope of the heart, do not like it; when dislike it, it is also not valued for him.
 Because then, Worldman said:
 "[Worldly like this:] the one who had forged his thirst from love before disintegration, not by the forefront,
 What is not supposed to be counted in the middle is not valued for him."
 85. those who do not anger, do not fear, do not show off, and those who do not regret

He was born of remorse, the remorse of his heart, and the confusion of intent; "I have done evil words, and good deeds have not been done by me... and evil deeds have been done by me." He was born of remorse, the remorse of his heart, and the chaos of his mind; 'I did the death, and I did not.

When telling many; when talking about many; when it says many; when saying many, when saying many, he speaks after consideration, exploration and exploration. He does not speak of those who are spoken by evil, who are spoken by evil, who are spoken by evil, who are spoken by evil, who are spoken by evil. The words that evil speaks. For the afterthought.

 "Indeed, he is the Muni of his own words": "Here, after Bichu has discarded his words, he is a man of falsehood, the true, the trustworthy, the trustworthy, the man who is free of deception to the world. After he has discarded the words, he is a distant word: after he heard it, he does not say there to be a divination to these people, or, after he heard it from there, he does not say here to divescend to them, like this, He is the mediator of division, a distributor of harmony, the loving, the loving and the collaborator, the person who likes and rejoins, and speaks of the word of harmony. After discarding the bad words, he is away from the crude vices, the soft, pleasant, cute and heart-heartedAs such words are spoken by him, the graceful words of all, which are loved by all, and the pleases of all. He is a person who has discarded the filthy language: He is the Speaker of the Right Time, the Speakers of the Facts, the Good, as the Law, as the Law; He speaks of value, reason and restraint at the appropriate time , Words of interest [AN.4.198]. He has four words of good deeds, and speaks four without fault.

"Muni", Mune is called wisdom, that is Hui, understanding... (medium) insane, choice method, positive... (medium) beyond the dyed net after he is Muni." For him is indeed the words of Homemade Muni.
 Because then, Worldman said:
 "The man who is not angry, he who is not afraid, and he who does not show off, and
 He is indeed a Muni whose words have been self-made."
 86. In the future, he does not lament the past,
 On the touch saw the far away, and he was not guided upon seeing him.
 "Unbound in the future": obsession is called thirsty love, that is greed, lust (total greed)... (medium) greed, greedy, bad roots. And whoever is for him who is persevering, his thirst is cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, and cannot be born, and burned by the fire of wisdom, so is not bound in the future.

' He is not sad; my ears... my nose... my tongue... my body... my color... my voice... my smell... my taste... my touch... my home... my group (all)...

 Or, he saw that the past was touched away from the future and the present; he saw that the future was touched away from the past and the present; and he saw that the present was touched away from the past and the future, or all those holy, without worries, and The touches of the air, those who touch greed him to see away from; in vain, in anger, with resentment, hiding evil, in arbitrary, jealous, stingy, hypocrisy, with cunning, stubborn, with passion, slow, with Extremely slow, to be slow, to relax, in all pollutions, in all evil deeds, with all evil deeds, with all scorching heat, and in all irritations, and made him far away from all evil. For those who are far from seeing on the touch.
 "He was not guided": "For him, Sixty-two evil opinions have been cut off, cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to be born, burned by the wisdom fire, and he is not seen to be carried away, taken away, carried, carried or carried, carried, carried, carried, and carried. Nor return, do not return to that evil opinion as the core." To see on him is not guided.
 Because then, Worldman said:
 "He who is unbound in the future, he does not lament the past,
 On the touch saw the far away, and he was not guided in the sight."
 87. Those who have withdrawn, not tricky, do not desire, do not stingy,
 The unarrogant, the unwicked, and those who are not keen on discourse.
 "Exited, non-tricky": "Exited", "greedy has been disconnected state for the exited; has been disconnected state for the exited; deprecated state is exited; angry... resentment ... The evildoers... the arbitrary... jealous... the stingy... (medium) all unrighteous creations of the discarded state is the exited. This was said by Worldman, "The Bichu How is Bichu an exited? Bichu! Here, I am the slow of Bichu has been cut off, the roots have been cut off, like a rootless palm tree, become a non-living thing for the future, the Bichu! Bichu this is the exited. [AN.4.38]"" is an exited person.
 "Non-tricky", there are three kinds of trickery: the means by means of the trick, the deeds of behavior, the surrounding language of the trick.
 What is the trickery of the instrument? Here, the owners of the house invite Bichu with clothes, food, shelter, patient needs, medical necessities. He is a wicked desire, a person who desires nature, a person of hope, for clothing, food, shelter, the needs of the patient, Medical essentials expect more and refuse clothing, refuse to feed, refuse shelter, refuse patients' needs, medical essentials, and he says, "What is a high-value clothing for Salmon! Where the salmon should be put on a coat after picking rag from the mound or in front of the garbage pile or shop door, it is appropriate. What is it for Salmon with high value feeding! Where the Salmon should take a little bit of the spike to survive, it is appropriate. What is it for Salmon with a high value accommodation! It is appropriate that whamon should be those who live under the tree or in the mound or in the open ground. What is the need, medical necessities of high value patients for Salmon! It is appropriate that salmon should be made with a fermented drug of bovine urine or crushed Haliel. After taking it, he was dressed in coarse clothing; he was given a coarse feed, dwelt in a rough place, and with the necessities of a thick patient, and medicinal The owners knew him so: "This Salmon is the little wishful, a man who is enough, alone, a man away from the masses, a man whose vitality has been initiated, and the head of the head." They are more and more inviting their clothes, feeding, shelter, patient needs, medical essentials. "And he says, "Three of the present states have faithfulness men produce many fords: the current state of faith is a good man. The current state of many fords, the present state of the mercy of a man produces many fords, worthy of the present state of the present state of faith good men produce many ford. You are the believers, and I am the recipient, and if I do not, then you will be an outsider of Ford, which is not needed for me, but for the sake of mercy on you And I accept it. After performing it, he received many clothes, many food [and lots of places], and received many patient needs, medical necessities. The frowning of whosoever such frowns; the path of the tricker, and the state of the trickery, this is the trickery of the instrument.
 What is the trick of behavior? Here, some kind of evil desires, those who seek nature, and those who seek respect [thought]: 'So, peopleI will be honored. ' He is placed to walk, set to stand, sit down, lay down, lay down, walk for a desire, stand for a desire, sit for a desire, lie down for a desire, such as walking by a person who is established, standing as a person who is established „ÄÅSit down as a person who is determined, lying down, and become visible as a zen. Whoever acts like this place, strengthen the placement, complete placement; the frowning of the frowning; the path of the tricker, the state of the trickery, this is the trickery of the deed.
 What is the perimeter trick? Here some kind of evil desires, those who seek nature, and those who desire respect [thought]: 'Then people will respect me. ' He spoke according to holy law, and he said, Whoever is dressed like this, he is the Salmon of great power. He said, "Whoever holds a bowl like this... holding a copper bowl... holding a filter tank... holding a filter bag... holding the keys... wearing shoes... a belt... a tie... he is the salmon of great power." And he said, Whosoever his monk is like this, he is the Salmon of great power. He said, "Whoever his teacher is like this... equates with a monk like this... as a teacher... friends... acquaintances... companions... He is the Salmon of great power." He said, Whosoever dwells like this, is Salmon, the great power. He said, "Whoever lives in a half-roof like this... lives in high buildings... in flat houses... in cave... in the caves... in the cottage... in the chalet... in the Lookout... The round house... lives in a shed... in a lecture hall... in a tent... under a tree... he is the shamon of great power."
 Or, the constant frowning; the constant frowning; the constant tricker; the constant nagging; the person who is respected by his mouth, who says such deep, secret, subtle, secret, secrecy, born, empty talk : "This Salmon gets this quiet place to wait until." Whoever frowns like this; the path of the tricker, the state of the trickery, this is the circumference of the trickery. For him these three trickery things: the means of the scheme, the trick of behavior, the conspiracy of the surrounding language has been cut off, cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to be born, by wisdom fire Burner, he is called a non-tricky." For exited, non-tricky.
 "Those who do not desire, do not stingy": "'Enthusiasm is called thirsty love, that is greedy, lust... (medium) greed, greedy, bad root. Whoever for him this desire, thirst of love has been cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, can not be born, burned by wisdom fire, he is called not enthusiastic, he does not desire... all the voices... all smells... ... Taste... all touches [... all the law]... family... groups (public)... shelter... benefits... reputation... praise... music... clothes... food... shelter... patient needs and medicine Necessities... want... color circles... colorless... want to have... colorless... want to have... do not want to have... I want to have... The future... now... what I see... what he heard... feel... He does not desire, does not want, do not accept, do not pray, do not want, do not want, do not desire." For those who do not desire. "Not stingy", there are five kinds of saving: [right] of the living, the saving of home, the profit of the stingy, praise of the stingy, the law of stingy, where such a stingy, saving stingy, saving state, greedy, stingy, Stinky, heart-clenched state, which is called stingy. In addition, stingy is also stingy; the world is also stingy; stingy is also stingy, which is called stingy. Whosoever for him has been cut off, cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to be born, burned by wisdom fire, he is called the unstingent. For those who do not want, do not stingy.
 "The unarrogant, not evil": "Pride" has three types of arrogance: the pride of the body, the arrogance of words, the arrogance of the heart. What is the arrogance of the body?
