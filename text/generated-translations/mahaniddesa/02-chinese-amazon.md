 "They are unreliably because they are not freed from others": "They are unreliably with joy, orIt is hard to relive here. How is it that things are hard to relive with them with pleasure?

 "Because they are not free from others," they can't pull out others who fall into the mud. This is said by Worldman, 'Pure! "He is a man who falls into the mud and will pull out the others in the mud." This is not possible. Pure Tuo! "He is undisciplined, untrained, un-Nibbana and will make others revolt, train, Nibbana." This is not possible. [MN.8] 'This is because it is not free from others.
 Or, you do not have any other reliever, if they can be freed by their own power (fortitude), with their own strength, with their own energy, with their own efforts (brave), to their own human forces. , with their own human power, to their own human vitality, to their own people's efforts, to their own right path, follow the road, not the opposite, according to the righteousness of the road, the law, when the implementation They can be freed, because they are not freed from others.
 This is also said by Worldman: [Ni.22]
 "For relief I will not be able to: Dudagor! Any doubter in the world,
 When you know the most winning method, you will get through this storm."
 This is also because it is not freed from others.
 This is also said by Worldman: [Dph.12,165]
 "Himself who has done evil, and they become polluted,
 And he who does not do evil himself, and he becomes clean,
 Clean and unclean are separate, not one can make the other clean. '
 This is also because it is not freed from others.
 This is also said by Worldman, 'Same, Brahmen! Nibbana lived, guided by the way of Nibbana, my advice to live, however, when my disciples were so admonished and so admonished, there were some Nibbana that reached the end, some did not arrive, Brahmen! What can I do here? Brahmen! As a guide. [MN.107] Buddha only tells (refers to) the way that they can be relied when they do it. ' This is also because it is not freed from others." For them is difficult to relive because they are not freed from others.
 "Expect later or even above the previous": "later called the future, formerly known as the past, in addition, after the past, the future and present are behind; after the future, the past and present are ahead.

'My body was like that in the past, and touched it was like that. ' ... 'I mean, it was like that. The law was like that.That's it. ' There, knowledge is bound by desire, and when it is bound by it, rejoice it; and when it rejoice it [MN.133], so it is also expected above the previous.
 Or, whoever used to laugh, speak, and play with a woman, he tastes it, wants it, and because of it comes to happiness [AN.7.50], so it is also expected above the previous.
 How is it to look forward to later? "I will have this color in the future." Look for joy there, 'I will have this kind of suffice in the future. ... I think this way in the future. ...

'My future will be like that, and the jastias will be like that. ' Hope for the unobtained heart, because of the hope of the heart, rejoice it; when it rejoins it, it is also expected above the later.
 Or, 'I will become heavens, or one of the heavens with this forbidden, and miserable, and Van. ' Hoping for the unacquired heart, by the hope of the heart, rejoice it; when it rejoins it, it is also expected above the later." Looking forward to later or even above the previous.

 Because then, Worldman said:
 "They are bound by the joy of the reason they want, because they are not free from others,
 I look forward to later or even before, in those desires or above the previous ones."

 "The stingers are fixed on top of their injustice": "The "skimps", "They go down" are stingers; "The stingers" are also known as the stingers; "words, lines, teachings, and teachings to Buddhist disciples "They don't care" for the stingers. How is 'they go down' for the stingers? They went to Hell; they went to the beasts; and they went to the evil world, so they went down for the stingers. How is the "stingy man" also called the skimp? There are five kinds of stingy: [right] of living, home saving, profit, praise of the stingy, law, where such a saving, saving stingy, stingy state, greedy, stingy, stingy, heart grip state, which is called stingy. In addition, stingy is also stingy; the world is also stingy; stingy is also stingy, which is called stingy. With this stingy, intolerant, people become relaxed, so that they are called the stingers.

 They cry when they have bitterness: where will we exist after death from here?"
 10. So here people should learn, should know any "wrong" in the world,
 That reason should not be wrong, because the wise men say that this life is less.
 "So here man should learn": "Therefore, 'for that reason, that cause, that cause, that cause, and that cause, when seeing this oversuffering on the desire. ' For that. "Should learn", there are three kinds of studies: add abduction, add heart, add Hui learning.
 What is Additions? Here, Bichu is a ring bearer who lives in the protection of the home-made porotty forks, is well on the way and the border, seeing horrible in micro-crime, learning after being held in the school.

 What is Adosted Wisdom? Here, Bichu is a man of wisdom, with a guide to birth and extinction; holy, insight, and the direction of bitterness completely extinct [the Wisdom], he knows, 'This is bitter. ' "This is a bitter set." "It is bitter." "This is the path that leads to bitterness." To be honest, 'These are troubles. ' To be honest: 'This is a set of troubles. ' To be honest: 'This is annoyance. ' To be honest: 'This is a guide to annoyance. ' This is the addition of Wisdom.

' Man, human beings, human beings... (Central) the born of Monu." So right here people should learn.
 "It should be known that whosoever is unrighted' in the world": "Whosoever, all completely, in every aspect, completely, without residue, the whole land, this is the word of "whosoever." "Should know the "incorrect", you should know that the incorrect profession is "incorrect"; should know the incorrect language is "incorrect"; it should know that the incorrect intentions are "incorrect"; should know the incorrect Kill is "wrong"; should know that the wrong is not given and taken as "incorrect"; should know that the wrong evil is "incorrect"; it should know that the false falsehood is "incorrect"; should know the wrong Distinguistic words are "incorrect"; should know that the bad bad words are "incorrect"; you should know that the bad greed is "incorrect"; should know that the incorrect greed is "incorrect" Malicious is' incorrect '; it should know that the bad evil is' incorrect '; you should know about the wrong behavior "wrong"; should know about the five kinds of incorrectness is "incorrect"; should know about The five covers of the incorrect are "wrong": should know, should know, should be different, should know, should be through. "In the world," in the worlds of bitter worlds... For what should be known to be "incorrect" in the world.
 "By that reason should not do wrong": "[to] the cause of an incorrect career should not be wrong; the cause of the wrong language should not do itPositive; the cause of bad intentions should not do wrong; the cause of the wrong killing should not be wrong; the cause of the wrong failure to give should not do wrong; the wrong evil cause should not be wrong; not correct The cause of false words should not do wrong; the cause of the incorrect diversion should not be wrong; the cause of the bad bad words should not do wrong; the cause of incorrect greed should not be wrong; the cause of bad greed Should not do wrong; the cause of bad malice should not do wrong; the cause of the wrong evil should not do wrong; the cause of the wrong behavior should not be wrong; the five causes of injustice should not do wrong The cause of the wrong five covers should not be wrong; the cause of incorrect thinking should not be wrong; the cause of bad hope should not be wrong; the cause of an incorrect desire should not be wrong: should not practice, It should not be fully practiced, should not be held after turning." For that reason should not be wrong.
 "For the wise say that life is less": "Life" is the survival of life; life, survival, the turn of action; and the guardian of life, the root of life. In addition, life is less with two factors: the limited life of survival is less, or less with natural (self-flavored) finite life. How is the limited life of survival is less? In the past heart moment lived, [but] is not alive, will not live; in the future heart moment will live, [but] is not alive, in the past; in the present heart moment now live, [but] the past is not alive, The future will not live.
 "Life and the individual, all (only) music and bitterness,
 Take a single heart: can turn up quickly in a moment.
 All the heavens survive, eighty-four thousand robbers,
 But neither do they live by two hearts.
 And whosoever dies here, or surviving, is destroyed.
 All those who have gone are, the same cannot be restored.
 Whosoever is destroyed immediately, and whosoever will be destroyed,
 [And] in the midst of those who were destroyed, there was no inequality in the special phase.
 He is not born from what has not happened, and he lives now,
 The destruction of the heart becomes an anchored in the highest interest of death.
 They occur as the downward [flow], are intended to make changes,
 They turn [such as] a flow of water that is not cut off, with six edges.
 The destroyed came not stored, in the future there is no heap,
 And whosoever is born they survive, as mustard at the tip of the cone [moment]
 Destruction is placed before the laws that were born,
 The bad ways they remain, not mixed with the previous ones.
 And they came unseen, and they saw depart from the destruction,
 As lightning in the air, they are born and dissipated."
 This is the limited life of survival is less.
 How is the limited life of nature (self-flavored) is less? Life depends on income; Life as income dependence; Life is dependent on income; Life is [four] large species of dependence; Life is the dependence of food for the formation of food; Life as the dependence of life; Life as the sense Dependence: These fundamentals are weak; these genes are weak; whoever uses them for their origin is weak; whoever uses them as power is weak; these common bases are weak; these Connections are weak; these are innate weak; whoever is connected to them are weak; these are often weak; these are inconsistent; these do not stand on each other; they destroy each other (all familiar); not each other. of the asylum, and these do not make each other stand; nor is it found any of the creators.
 "No one has disappeared because of any man, and these are indeed all evil,
 These were born from before, and whosoever the producer they were dead before,
 The former and the latter did not see each other.
 This is a limited life of nature (self-flavored) is less.
 In addition, comparing the life of the four kings angjin, life is less, life is negligible, life is only some, life is instant, life is fast, life is short, life is not long, life is not long, life is not Long stay, thirty-three days Tenjin... (middle) night Tenjin... rate Tenjin Tenjin... Rakuten Tenjin... He is comfortable Tenjin... compared to the life of the Tenjin, for people life is less, life is Trivial, life is only some, life is instant, life is fast, life is short, life is not long, life is not long, life is soon to live.
 This is said by Worldman
 "Picchu! The life of a man is less, and shall come to the next life, and the wise shall awaken, and he who should do good, and repair his family. Living without death, Bichu! Where living elders he hasA hundred years or more."
 "The lifespan of a man is less, and the good should disregard it,
 Should be alive as the head is burned [because] no death does not come. [SN.4.9]
 Day and night passes, life is extinguished,
 The life of a dead person is exhausted, such as water in a small river." [SN.4.10]
 "For the wise say that this life is less": "The wise is the sage; the wise is the sage; the wise is the sage; the wise is the sage; the wicked is the sage, and wisdom is called Hui, that is wisdom, Understanding, Simple Selection, Study, Selection, Identification, Identification, Close Inspection, Xianzhi (Euthology), Skillful, Smart, Thinking, Thinking, Review, General (Comprehensive), Wisdom, Wisdom, Wisdom, Wisdom, Thorn, Wisdom „ÄÅHui Gen„ÄÅWisdom„ÄÅWisdom„ÄÅHui Hall„ÄÅHuiguang„ÄÅHui bright„ÄÅHui light„ÄÅHui Bao„ÄÅIntriguing„ÄÅChoosing method„ÄÅPositive view [See no hindrance (1) talk of wisdom paragraph 109.], with that wisdom has The state is wise. In addition, the Sage of the Wins, the Sage of the World, the Sage of Origin, the Sage of Remembrance, Normal Sage, the Sage of God, the Root Sage, the Sage of Power, the Sage of the Word, the Sage of Fruit Nibbana sage, those sages say: "For men life is less, life is trivial, life is only some, life is a moment, life is fast, life is short, life is not long, life is not long, life It was soon to live." And they say so, tell it, and speak so, say so, and say so. For the wise say that this life is less.
 Because then, Worldman said:
 "So here people should learn and know that whoever is "wrong" in the world,
 That reason should not be wrong, for the wise say that this life is less."

He has departed, departed, liberated, and has been bound, and he dwelt away from the restrained heart. The wise ones are not contaminated in what they see and smell.
 Because then, Worldman said:
 "On both sides of the revolt, they know that they have no desire behind the touch,
 Whoever rebukes himself, he does not perform it, and the wise is not contaminated in what he saw and smell (Ceylon version)."
