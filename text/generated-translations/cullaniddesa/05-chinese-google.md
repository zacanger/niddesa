4. Explanations asked by student Mairegu

18. [Venerable Maitreya like this:] Lord, I ask you, please tell me this. I
  think you are a person who knows the Vedas, and has personally practiced.
From where did these sufferings come into being: of all kinds of different forms in
any world? (??)

"Master! I ask this, please tell me this": ""I ask", there are three kinds of
queries: the query of the explanation of the unseen (...omitted, see previous).

"I ask you", (...omitted).

"[Like this Venerable Maitreya]": (...omitted).

"I think you are a person who knows the Vedas and who have personally
practised": I think you are "aware of the Vedas". I think you are a "person who
has practised yourself", I know so; I agree. "A person who knows the Vedas, who
has already practiced himself", How is the Blessed One one who knows the Veda?
The Vedas are called wisdom, the root of wisdom, power of wisdom, dhamma
enlightenment, investigation, vipassana, right view of the four realms. The
Blessed Ones are those who have reached the ultimate (target), who have lived,
aged, and died in the Vedas; those who have reached the ultimate, those who have
reached the end, those who have reached the boundary;  those who have reached
the refuge; those who have reached the shelter, those who have reached no fear;
have arrived without being dead; those who reach the undead are those who have
reached Nibbana. Or "the one who has known the Vedas" is the one who knows the
Vedas, or the known state of the Seven Dhammas is the one who knows the Vedas:
to be seen and known, suspicion being known, refraining from being known, greed
[being known], anger [being known], ignorance [being known], sloth being known,
and its evil and unwholesome methods are known: succumbing to polluting,
recurring, fearing, and it will live and die in the future.

[Blessed One: "Sexy!" (?? color forced asia?)][Sn.3.6, 534偈]

"Select all the Vedas, all those belonging to the Sramanas and Brahmins that
exist here,
is free from greed in all feelings, and after surpassing all Vedas, he is knows
Vedas well."

This is the Blessed One who knows the Vedas.

How is he the Blessed One who has already practiced himself? The Blessed One is
the person who has practiced the body, the mind, the wisdom, the mindfulness,
the righteousness, studied the gods, the root, the power, the enlightenment.
Those who have practised the path, those who have given up the polluters, those
who have been unshakable, those who have testified, for those who have been
omniscient, have given up, have practiced, have given up testimony, have
renounced what should be renounced, practised and ought to be practised, not
small, large, very deep, immeasurable, difficult to be; Those who have a deep
understanding of many treasures, such as the ocean, are those who possess six
peaces:

After seeing the form with the eyes, I am neither happy nor sad, and live in
peace, mindful and righteous; after hearing the sound with the ear... after
smelling the smell with the nose... after tasting the taste with the
tongue... touching the touch with the body... After knowing the Dhamma with
consciousness, I am neither happy nor sad, but live in peace, mindfulness and
righteousness [DN.33 Liuchang Residence].

After seeing form with his eyes, he does not desire, dislike, and does not cause
greed to occur in the desired form. His body is already established, his mind is
already established, and he is built up and liberated by virtue. After seeing the
undesirable form, he does not become discouraged, have unrestrained mind,
unintentional sorrow, unintentional malice, his body is already inhabited, his
mind is already inhabited, and he is built up by goodness and kindness within
himself.

After seeing the form with the eyes, the body has been inhabited and the mind
has been inhabited in the agreeable and undesirable forms, and the self is
built up and freed by the kindness; after listening to the sound with the ear...
(omitted), knowing with the consciousness After the Dhamma, both the body and the
mind have been established in both the agreeable and undesirable methods, and
they are established and liberated by virtue within themselves [SN.46.6].

After seeing the form with eyes, you will not get drunk when you are infected,
you will not be angry when you are angry, you will not be foolish when you
become foolish, and you will not get
drunk when you are drunk (??). Don’t contaminate what will be contaminated; after
hearing the sound with your ears... (omitted) after knowing the Dhamma with
consciousness, you will not be contaminated on what will be contaminated...
(omitted), and don’t pollute when you pollute (??).

There is only so much in what you see; there is only so much in what you hear;
there is only so much in what you perceive; there is only so much in what you
know [SN.35.95], not contaminated by in what you see; not contaminated by what
you hear; not contaminated by what you perceive; not contaminated by what you
know, and he who is unsatisfied (has no obsession??), [virtue] without loss, not
dependent, and not bound by what is known, freed from the bondage, he lives with
a liberated heart; in terms of what he hears... (omitted) in terms of what he
knows, he is the one without attachment, the one who does not lose (??), the one
who does not depend on, and the one who is not bound. Freed from the bondage, he
lives with a liberated heart.

The Blessed One has (existing ??) eyes, the Blessed One has eyes to see form,
the Blessed One has no desires and greed, and the Blessed One’s heart is kind
and liberating; ...(omitted) ears to hear...; ...nose to smell...; ...tastes
with the taste...; ...touches with the body...: The Blessed One is intentional,
the Blessed One knows the Dhamma with consciousness, the Blessed One has no
desires and greed, and the Blessed One has a kind heart and is free [SN.35.232].

Eyes are joyful in form, joyful in color, the Blessed One has regulated, tuned,
guarded, protected, and taught the self-control of it; ears are joyous in
sound... (omitted) the nose rejoices in the smell... the tongue rejoices in the
taste... the body is joyful in touch... and the Blessed One has regulated,
tuned, guarded, protected, and taught the self-control of it, which means to
rejoice in the Dhamma, to be happy in the Dhamma, the Blessed One has
regulated... the self-control of it. [MN. 75].

the king boarded the (??),

[Dhp. 321-323]

They are unwavering in all kinds of slowness (sloth?), becoming liberated and reborn,
have reached the adjusted imperial position, they are the victors in the world.
[SN.22.76]

Those who have cultivated their roots, inside and outside themselves: in the
world,
piercing this and other worlds, when he is waiting for death: he is the one who
has been transferred (??)." [Sn.3.6, 521 verse]

This is the Blessed One who has already himself practiced.

"I think you are a person who is familiar with the Vedas and who has personally
practiced. From where did these sufferings arise": "From where", the question of
doubt, the question of confusion, the question of more
than one question, this is a rhetorical question, ironic question,
why on earth? "Where from." "Suffering", suffering from birth, suffering
from old age, ...from sickness, ...from death,
... sorrow, ...despair, loss, hell,
the animal world, ghosts, human beings;
rooted in suffering from birth, rooted in the suffering of living in the womb,
rooted in the suffering of birth, the suffering of the living being dependent,
the suffering of the living being manipulated by others, ...due to
their own actions, ...due to the actions of others,
from change, eye disease, ear disease, nose disease, tongue
disease, body disease, head disease, external ear disease, mouth disease, tooth
disease, ...(omitted, see previous chapters)... the suffering of the decline
of seeing. From the very beginning of these dhammas, they have been known; since
they disappeared, they have been known, the retribution is based on kamma; kamma
is based on kamma  (??), the name is based on form; and form is based on name. Those
who are followed by birth, accompanied by birth, followed by age, conquered by
disease, struck by death, living in suffering, with no shelter, and no refuge,
are called suffering. Where did these sufferings come
from? Where did it arise? Where is it produced? Where did it happen from? Where
was it born? Where did it appear? What is the cause? What is its set (??)? What is its
birth? What is its root cause? He inquired about the root of these sufferings;
he inquired about the reason; he inquired about the cause; he inquired about the
arising; he inquired about the emergence; he inquired and waited (??); he inquired
about food; he inquired about the cause; he inquired about the fate; he inquired
about the set, he asked and begged, requested, make it clear. "From where did
these sufferings arise".

"Of all kinds of different shapes and forms in any world": ""Of all kinds", all
completely, every aspect completely, no surplus, the whole earth, this is the
ubiquitous language, which is "anything." "In any world", the world of suffering, the
world of humans, the world of heaven, the world of aggregates, the world of
worlds, and the world of existence. "Various shapes and forms", various kinds
and types of suffering. "All kinds in any world"

19. [Blessed One: "Milegu!"] You ask me about the occurrence of suffering, and I
    will say that for you as if you know (?? "as if I know it" "as if the know"):
all sufferings occur due to dependence: all kinds of different forms in any
world.

who knows, the other (??), the one who penetrates, not from hearsay, not from

reasoning, Not because of theoretical contemplation, not because of the insights
accepted after contemplation; a method that is personally proven and self-proven
by oneself, I will say that. "Waiyi knows that I will tell you that.

"All sufferings occur due to dependence": ""Dependence", there are ten kinds of
dependence: dependence of craving, dependence of seeing, of pollution, of kamma,
of evil deeds; the attachment to food, the attachment to disgust, to the four
attachments, to the six inner states, to the six types of consciousness, to all
sufferings with heart and righteousness; these are called ten attachments. "All
suffering", suffering from birth, suffering from old age, suffering from
death... (omitted). From the beginning of these dhammas, they have been known;
Knowing, kamma is based on kamma; name is based on form; form is based on name.
Being followed by birth, accompanied by birth, followed by old age, conquered by
illness, struck by death, and suffering, those who live in suffering, without
shelter, and without refuge are called suffering. These sufferings are based on
attachment as a cause, attachment as a linking cause, attachment as a condition,
and dependence is the cause of their occurrence, generation, arising,
production, birth, and being born." It is the occurrence of sufferings due to
dependence.

"Suffering repeatedly reaches the dull": "Birth, suffering, sickness, death,
sorrow, despair, and bitterness come again and again, fully arrive, grasp, cling
to." Suffering repeatedly arrives. "The dull", the dull, the ignorant, the
unwise, the indiscriminate, and the inferior. "Suffering repeatedly reaches the
dull.

the attachment." For this reason. "The knower", those who understand, those who
know, those who know others, those who see, and those who perceive: "All actions
are impermanent"... (omitted) "All actions are without self"... (omitted) "Any
collection of dhamma is an extinction" The one who understands, the one who
knows, the one who knows others, the one who penetrates. "Should not be
dependent", and should not be dependent upon, the attachment that should not be
seen, ...should not be polluted, ...not be evil, ...should not be food,

consciousness, should not be caused, should not be produced, and should not be
caused to arise. "For this reason, those who know should not be dependent.

called the follower." It is the follower of the life and production of
suffering.
