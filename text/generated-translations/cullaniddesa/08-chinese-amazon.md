7. Note by Brahmen, students of Nandra
 46. [His Holiness as this:] Why do people say that there are many Munies in the world?
 Do they say Muni is a wise man? Or is it alive?
 “There are Munies in the world”: “Existence” exists, is known, there, found. “In the world”, in the worlds of bitter worlds... The name of Moni's wicked outlanes, Nigantas, the hair and the bitter. For the existence of the Moni in the world.
 “[His Holiness like this]”: “Like this, the continuation of the sentence... (medium) “His Holiness”, [this is] the word of love... (medium), the name of the Brahman... ” For [His Holiness like this].
 “Why do people say this? “People are for Chardly, Brahmen, Bisha, the Sudala, in the family, out of the family, the heavens, the heavens, the people. “(They) say, “They tell, talk, explain, and speak. “Why is it so”, the question of doubts, confusion questions, doubts, more than one question, such as anti-question, questioning, why, why in the end?” Why do people say that?
 “Whether they say Muni is a wise man”: “They say, tell, talk, explain, speak, say that Muni has, fully has, arrives, fully arrives, fully enough, fully sufficient, with eight supreme wisdom, or five myths Wisdom.” To whether they say Muni is a wise man?
 “Still alive”: “Or do they say, tell, talk, explain, say, say that Muni has, fully has, arrives, fully arrives, fully enough, fully sufficient, have engaged in all kinds, poles, first The hard-man, the unclean life.” For or alive?
 Because then, the Brahman said:
 “Why do people say that there are Monies in the world [as this, His Holiness:]
 Do they say Muni is a wise man? Or is the one who lives?”
 47. not to see, not to smell, not wisdom, hard to Tuo! Here the good men say Muni,
 Those who live a life without distress and without desire after the Legion, I say they are “Muni.”
 “Not seeing, not in the smell, not wisdom”: “Not in sight, not pure. “Not to smell”, not to smell pure. “It is not wise,” neither is it eight to wisdom, nor by five gods, nor wickedness. It is not seen, the smell of it, or wisdom.
 “Nanda! The good here say Muni: “The good ones,” those who are good, those who are good, those who are good, those who are good, those who have arisen, those who remembered the best, those who remember the best, those who are righteous, and those who are righteous, The root of the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good, the good of the fruit, the Nibbana, they do not say, do not talk, do not talk, do not say, do not say, do not say that Muni has, completely possesses, Reach, fully arrive, fully sufficient, fully sufficient, have the purity, or the purity of what is heard, or Eighth wisdom, or wickedness, or evil, or see, or smell, or wisdom.” For hard to do! The good guys here say Muni.
 “Whosoever lives without distress and without desire after leaving the Legion, I say they are “Muni”: Legions are called Demons, devil acts devil, devil acts devil, wicked devil, greed for demons; For the demon; devil army; anger... (medium) resentment... hidden evil... arbitrary... jealousy... hypocrisy... cunning... stubborn... Passion... slow... slow... relax... ... all pollution... all evil deeds... all annoyed... all irritated... all irritated... all bad creation as an army of demons. This was said by Worldman [Sn.3.2, 438-441]
 “To be your first legion, disjoy is called the second,
 Hunger and thirst are your third, thirst love is called fourth.
 Sleep is your fifth, fear is said to be sixth,
 Doubt is your seventh, and hiding is your eighth.
 Profits fame respectfully, with whoever wrong gets fame,
 Whoever will praise themselves, disdain others.
 Demon! This is your Legion, the evil (black) attacker,
 He who has no courage does not defeat him, after victory will be able to gain peace.”
 When all Demon and all hostile pollution are conquered, defeated, destroyed, collapsed, turned open face, because then they are called after the Legion. “No distress”, greed is distressed; is distressed; bitter is distressed; anger is distressed; resentment is distressed...Those who are cut off, cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to be born, burned by wisdom fire, they are called no distress. “No desire”: desire is called thirsty love, that is greed, lust (total greed)... (medium) greed, greed, bad root. Whoever for them this desire is cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, incapable of being born, burned by wisdom fire, they are called the unwilling, Arrohan, the troubles have been exhausted. “Whoever lives without distress and without desire after leaving the Legion, I say they are 'Muni'”: “Those who leave the Legion without distress and without desire to live (walk), live, act, turn, guard To make the survival, and make the living, I say, I explain, I teach, I tell, I build, I uncover, I interpret, I explain, I explain. They are the Muni of the world.” For those who leave the Legion who live without distress and without desire, I say they are “Muni.”
 Because then, Worldman said:
 “Not to see, not smell, not wisdom, hard to do! Here the good men say Muni,
 I say that those who live a life without distress and without desire after the Legion, I say they are “Muni.”

 “Known after thirsty love”, after the three known thirst love. “No annoyance”, there are four kinds of troubles: the troubles of desire, some troubles, see troubles, unclear troubles. For them, these troubles have been cut off, the roots have been cut off, like a rooted palm tree, become inhabited for the future, they are called no worries, Arrohan, the troubles have been exhausted, for all know that thirsty love After the trouble-free person. “Knowing that those who have no worries after their thirst, I also say, 'They have passed through the blast, '” I also say, 'The riot of their desire has passed; some of them have passed; and the riot of seeing has passed; The riot of unknown has passed; all the circuits have passed, come out, have crossed, crossed, crossed, and overcome.” To know the worry-free people after thirsty love, I also say, “They survive the storm.”
