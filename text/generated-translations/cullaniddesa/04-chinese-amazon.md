“They are devotes to offering, and greedy, I sayThey have not been born and

They pray for profit, and they are dedicated to giving, greedy, and I say they
have not lived “born, old.”

Because then, the Brahman said:

“[His Holiness the Fullounagh, like this:] If those who sacrifice the devotion

Brahmen! Slow is indeed your burden, anger is smoke, vain is gray,

Or, in ten lines of wrath was born: “He has done against me. [AN.9.29]” Anger
was born; “He did against me.” Anger is born; “He will do against me.” Anger is

breakdown is broken; sometimes anger is only rupture, but not as per limb.
Sometimes anger is only the extent of each limb pulled apart, but not as deadly;
sometimes anger is deadly, but not as far as abandonment has been abandoned.
When an anger kills others and kills himself, this is a situation where anger
arrives further to the rise and further reaches growth. Whoever is for him that
anger is cut off, cut off, calmed down, stopped, unable to be born, and burned
by wisdom fire, he is called a smoke-free.

The state of anger has been disconnected is smoke-free; the state of anger has
been known to be smoke-free; Anger is smoke-free because of its already known
state; Anger has been severed is smoke-free. “There is no distress,” greed is
distressed; the bitterness is distressed; anger is distressed; resentment is

said, I explain, I teach, I tell, I build, I uncover, I interpret, I clarify, I
explain.” For the silent, smoke-free, distressed, hopeless, I said he spent
“birth, aging.”

Because then, Worldman said:

“[Worldmark: “Rich Lou Nagar!”] After considering the upper and lower in the
world, for him there is no wavering place in the world,

Silent, smoke-free, distressed, hopeless, I said he spent “birth, aging.”
