(medium) can overcome." To be able to spend love in the world.

37. [Worldest: "Dudagar!"] Whosoever Thou knoweth, in the upper and lower, and
    in the middle,

When you know that this is "dyed" in the world, do not make thirsty love in all
kinds of things.

"Whosoever thou knoweth": "Whosoever thou knowest, whosoever thou knowest [and
thou knowest], you know it, you pass through." For whoever you know. "Dudagar,"
Worldman named the Brahman by name. "Worldworld," this is synonymous with
respect... Anri (Kana), the testimony of (medium), that is Worldworld." For
[Worldest: "Dudagar!"].

"On the top, down and in the middle": "Upper" is the future, "Down" for the
past, the "Middle Quartet" is the present; "Upper" is the world of heaven,
"Down" is the world of Hell, and the "Middle Quartet" for mankind Worlds. Or,
"upper" is good law, "lower" is bad law, the "middle four" is no remembered;
"upper" is no color, "lower" is the boundary of desire, the "middle four" is the
boundaries of color; "upper" is joy, and "down" is suffering, The "Middle
Quartet" is not afflicted; "Above" is above the soles of the feet, "Down" is
under the hair, and the "Middle Quartet" is in the middle. For the upper, bottom

this is bound, this is an obstacle. ' After knowing, after understanding, after
measuring, judging, after each, after figure out." To know that this is "dyed"
in the world.

"Do not make thirsty love in all kinds of things": "Thirst love", thirst love of
color, thirst love of the voice... thirst love of the (medium) method. "Among
the species," among the seed of the trade, in the desire to have, in the
etiquity, in color; in the colourless, in colourless, in the colourless, in the
colourless trade, in There are times and again; in the fun, in the past, in the
birth of a repeated birth, in the birth of a repeated individual. Do not be
thirsty love, do not give birth to thirst love, do not produce thirsty love, do
not have thirst love, do not give up thirst, give off, depart thee, and make it
come to not exist." For you do not make thirsty love in all sorts.

Because then, Worldman said:

"[Worldest: Dudagar!"] Whosoever Thou knoweth, in the upper and lower, and in
the middle,

When you know that this is "dyed" in the world, do not make thirst love in all
kinds of things."

At the end of the Ode... (medium) "Daedeu! Worldson is my teacher, I am a
disciple."
