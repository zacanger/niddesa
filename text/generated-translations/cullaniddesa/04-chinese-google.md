3. Explanations asked by the Brahmin by student Fulunaga student

12. [Venerable Fulounaga like this:] Those who are undisturbed, the seer
of the roots, come with questions in need,
The immortals, people, Kshatriyas, Brahmins,
Are there many sacrifices in the world here? Lord, I ask you, please tell me
this.

"The one who is not disturbed, the one who sees the root": ""Disturbance is
called craving, that is greed, ... and unwholesome roots. For the Buddhas and
the Blessed One that disturbance is cut off, the root has been cut off, just
like a palm tree without roots, becoming non-existent, a non-living thing for
the future, so the Buddha is the undisturbed. In the disturbed state of
disconnection, the Blessed One does not waver; (???????) don’t shake when you
don’t get it; don’t shake when [have] reputation; don’t shake when you have no
reputation (bad reviews); don’t shake when you praise; don’t shake when you
reprimand; do not shake at times; do not shake, do not move, do not tremble, do
(?????). "The one who is not disturbed". "The one who sees the root", the
Blessed One sees the roots, is the seer of the cause, seer of the origin seer of
the waiting (origin), seer of the food (???), seer of the object, seer of the
condition, seer of the set of views.

There are three unwholesome roots: the unwholesome root of greed, of aversion,
and of ignorance.

This was said by the Lord: Bhikkhus! There are causes and conditions for these
three kamma gatherings, which three are there? Greed is the cause and condition
of kamma, hatred is the cause and condition of kamma, and delusion is the cause
and condition of kamma. Bhikkhus! It's not because of greed, hatred, or delusion
that the heavens are known, people are known, or any good interests are known,
monks! But because of greed, hatred, and delusion, the hell world is known, the
animal world is known, the hungry ghost world is known, or any evil interest
[AN.6.39] Individuals in hell, the animal world, and the hungry ghost world are
known. These three unwholesome roots, the Blessed One knows and sees, and so so
Blessed One is the seer of the root... (Omitted) the seer. There are three good
roots: the good root of no greed, of no hatred, and of no delusion.

This was said by the Lord: Bhikkhus! There are these three... (omitted) monks!
It's not that the hell of no greed, no hatred, no delusion is known, the animal
world is known, the hungry ghost world is known, or any evil interests are
known, monks! But without greed, without hatred, without delusion, heaven is known, man is
known, or any good interest: those in heaven and the world arise
and are known. The Blessed One knows and sees the three  good roots, so the
Blessed One is the seer of the root... (omitted) the seer.

This was said by the Lord: Bhikkhus! Any unwholesome Dhamma, unwholesome
division, unwholesome party [AN.1.56], all that is rooted in ignorance,
converge in ignorance, and eradicated with ignorance, all that will be
eradicated. [SN.20.1] The Blessed One knows and sees... (omitted).

This was said by the Lord: Bhikkhus! Bhikkhus! Any good law, good division, and
good party [AN.1.57], rooted in unbridledness (non-relaxation??), and unbridled as
reunion, this is said to be the number one among those laws. [SN.45.139]"
The Blessed One knows and sees... (omitted).

TODO: fix this block, it's the chain of dependent origination but the translation is odd.
Or, the Blessed One knows and sees: "Ignorance is the root of action, action is
the root of consciousness, consciousness is the root of mind and form, mind and
form are the roots of six places, the six are the roots of touch, touch is the root
of receiving, and feeling is the root of craving, craving is the root of taking,
taking the root of something, and having the root of growing, and birth is the
root of old age. The Blessed One knows and sees... (omitted).

Or, the Blessed One knew and saw: "The eye is the root of eye disease, the ear
is the root of ear disease, the nose ...of nasal disease, the tongue ...
of tongue disease, the body ...of body disease, and the mind
is the root of suffering. "The Blessed One knows and sees, so the Blessed One
is the seer of the root, the seer of the cause, the seer
of the origin, the seer of waiting (origin??), the seer of ??
food, the The seer of the condition, the seer of the
collection (aggregate??). "Is the perturbator (for the disturbance??), the seer of the root.

"[Like this Venerable Fulounage]": "Like this", the continuation of the
sentence... (Omitted) Venerable Fulounage.

"The ones in need come with questions": I come with questions as needed, I come
if I want to ask questions, I come if I want to hear questions, the
needy come with questions. Or, "the inquiries that belong to the question have
the need, the one who wants to ask the question, the one who wants to hear,
the needy [will] come, approach,, visit." Or when you have a question, you can and you
have enough reason to tell and answer the question I asked, "Please bear this
burden." In this way, "the ones in need come with questions".

"People who rely on immortals (fairies??)": "Rely on, stick to, enter,
or turn their hearts toward something. "Fairies", who are named immortals,
and whichever monks become hermits. "People" are called human beings."
People who depend on immortals and people.

"Kshatriyas, Brahmins, to the gods": "'Kshatris,' everything that is born of
Kshatriya. 'Brahmins', whoever calls others gentlemen. 'To the gods', evil fate,
the evil destiny of the disciple, the Niganta god of the disciple of Niganta,
(??) the knotter god of the knotter disciple, the marcher god of the marcher
disciple, the exiled god..., the the elephant god... , horse god,  bull god, dog
god, crow god, Vishnu god, the power of the power ring-keeper, the man of the
virtuous ring, the jewel of the virtuous ring, the fire..., the dragon .., the
golden-winged..., Yaksha, asura, Gandha, the great king god of the guard
[heaven], the moon god, sun god, Indra, Brahma....  Those who are worthy of
offering to them are their gods." For the Kshatriyas and Brahmins to the gods.

TODO: one translation uses "animal sacrifices" for each instance of the word
"sacrifices" here, which seemed incorrect, but cross-check with the Pali.??
"There are many sacrifices in the world": ""Sacrifice" is called a donation:
clothing, food, shelter, necessities for patients, medical necessities, food,
drink, cloth, transportation, garlands, spices, oils, bed, house, lamps and
candles. "As a sacrifice", wherever (whoever??) they seek, pursue, and beg for
clothing, food... (omitted) are used as sacrifices; wherever they prepare
clothing, food... are also used as sacrifices; wherever they give, provide, and
donate clothing, food... also make sacrifices. "Many", these sacrifices are
many, or the priests of these sacrifices are many, or there are many worthy
providers. How are there sacrifices many? The clothes, food... belong to (are??)
many, so these sacrifices are many.

How is it that there are many priests of these sacrifices? There are many
priests of these sacrifices: Kshatriya, Brahman, Vaisha, Sudra, laymen,
monks, heavens, and people, so there are many priests of these
sacrifices.

How is or are there many worthwhile providers (people who are worthy of support??)?
There are many Shamen, Brahmins, beggars, travelers, wanderers, and beggars,
so there are many worthy of offering. "Here is in the world", in the
human world. "To make sacrifices for many here in the world".

"My Lord, I ask you, please tell me": ""Asking", there are three kinds of
inquiry: inquiry about the explanation of the unseen, inquiry about the
confluence of the seen, and inquiry about the cut-off of doubt.

What is an inquiry about the unseen? It was an unknown, unseen, unmeasured,
unjudged, unclear characteristic, for the purpose of his wisdom, seeing,
measuring, judging, clear, he asked a question, which was an inquiry about the
unseen.

What is an inquiry about the confluence of the seen? A characteristic that
was known, seen, measured, judged, clear, and understood. He asked questions for
the purpose of confluence with other wise men. This is an inquiry of confluence
of the seen.

What is an inquiry for the cutting off of doubt? A leap into skeptics (??),
jump-in doubter (??), and born doubter: "Is that so? Isn't it
true? what is it then? How is it? He asks questions for the purpose of severance
of doubt. This is an inquiry for the severance of doubt. These are three types of
queries.

The next three kinds of inquiry: human inquiry, non-human inquiry, and inquiry
of the person.

What is a human inquiry? People asked questions after they went to
see the Buddha, the World-Honored One: asked the bhikkhus,
asked the Uvasai, ...Uvayis, ...kings, ...Kshatriya, ...Brahmins, ...Vaisha.
Asked about the dhamma, asked the lay people, asked the monks, this is a human
inquiry.

What is an inhuman inquiry? The non-people asked questions after they went to
see the Buddha, Blessed One: asked the dragons, ...golden-winged birds, yasha,
asuras, gandapo, kings, Indra, Brahmas, gods, this is an inhuman inquiry.

What is the inquiry of the person? All the physical bodies and limbs of the
World-Honored One's creative intentions are not lacking in the roots. The
transfiguration(??) asks questions after seeing the Buddha, the Blessed One, and
the Blessed One answers him. This is a trans-human inquiry. These are three
types of queries.

The next three kinds of inquiry: inquiry for one's own benefit, inquiry for the
benefit of others, and inquiry for the benefit of both. The next three:
inquiries about current interests, inquiries about future interests,
and inquiries about the highest interests. The next three: inquiry
for the benefit of no faults, inquiry for the benefit of no pollution, and inquiry
for the pure benefit. The next three: [about] past queries,
future queries, and current queries. The next three: [about] inquiries
within oneself, inquiries outside oneself, and inquiries within and outside
oneself. The next three: [about] good inquiries, unkind inquiries, and
non-remembering (unbearable??) inquiries. The next three: [about] Yun??, Jie (community??),
and Chu(??). The next three: about mindfulness,
about diligence, about spiritual content. The next three: about the root,
the strength, and the enlightenment.
The next three: about the Path, the Fruit, and Nibbana.

"I ask you", "I ask of you; I beg you; please make me clear; please tell
me". "Blessed One", which is synonymous with respect... Anri
(pseudonym) who testified, namely "Blessed One". "Please tell me this", please
say, please explain, please teach, please inform, please build (??), please uncover,
please analyze, please clarify. "Blessed One, I ask you, please tell me this."

TODO: "I look forward", or "looking forward"? Check with the Pali.
13. [Blessed One: "Fu Lou Na Ge!"] Any of these immortals, people, Kshatriyas,
Brahmins and gods,

TODO: "depend on" or "stop the"??
"They depend on aging as sacrifices": "Those who depend on aging, those
who are sick, those who depend on death, those who depend on sorrow, grief,
suffering, sorrow, and despair. When they are born dependent, when they
are dependent on aging; when they are dependent on aging, then they are
dependent on sickness; ...(omitted)on sickness...(omitted) death;

"Those who do not let go on the road of sacrifice", the sacrifice is called the
animal road, such as the holy road is the holy road; the heaven is the sky road;
the Sanskrit (??) road is the Sanskrit road; similarly, the sacrifice is called
the sacrifice road. "Do not let go", those who do not let go on the road of
sacrifice are respectful authors (authors??), constant authors, non-stop
authors, those who are not stuck in the habit, those who do not neglect their
desires, those who have the character, those who have more, and those who are
more important.

The one who targets that, the one who strives, the one who overcomes, the one
who increases, they are those who do not let go on the road of sacrifice:

sacrifice. "Lord! Are there really those who do not let go on the road of
sacrifice."

Summary:
1. People who are aging look forward to making sacrifices (= alms) in the next
   life, but they have not survived birth and senescence.
2. Those who are unshakable (no slow pollution of love), silence (to quell all
   unwholesome contrivance), smoke-free (cut off anger), no worries, and no
   desires (= no craving) will survive birth and aging. 10/17/2020 15:25
