One hundred races, one thousand races, one hundred thousand races, various developmental ages, various
Argumentative Kalpas, various developed open Kalpas, I have lived in the past. If so
I was a real person. Thus I became a tribal man. This is the color, this is the food

[APZ 81.6] (# apz81.6) # apz81.6 .ref .apz} "There is no doubt that Nja is missing"
Yja says to the lust called Uja. Is there any lust, attachment,
Whether greed, greed or evil has a root cause, this lust called nja is blessed
The futility of the Supreme Buddha was first broken. Karana like a dead palm tree
Received. Was utterly annihilated. Was made unproductive again.
Therefore, the Blessed Supreme Buddha is called Aneja. By lust or
Anaja will be destroyed as he is not able to cope with the shock.

[APZ 81.7] (# apz81.7) {# apz81.7 .ref .apz ‍ Blessed are you in profit
Not shocked. (3-1) 1 should be used from the point of view of 'profit')
Not shocked. Will not move. The suspicion that there is a quelled suspicion is a matter of ambiguity
Says. Suspects in grief ((4-11) 5 should be used.) That doubt is blessed
The Buddha sighed. Especially dried up. Calmed down. Was unfit to be born.
Wisdom burned in the fire. Therefore, there is a suspicion that the Buddha was also extinguished.

He went beyond consciousness. He went far beyond the point. Direct
He went beyond doing that. He went beyond the end, that is. questions

Whether the pleasures of this world are real or a sign of recognition, these images
Signs are the most prominent of the iconic images.
The signs are prominent. Cultivated Laddahu and Exceeded Wahhu.
For those who have lost all bodies, all reciprocal imagery has failed.
His image is that which has been weakened by the inexhaustible flow.

[APZ 82.2] (# apz82.2) # apz82.2 .ref .apz} "looks like nothing"
Akinchanayatana is the end, what is the point of saying nothing?
From the end of Akinchanayatana to the end of Vignananchayatana with mindfulness

Looks. Akinchanayatana tells the conclusion that there is nothing in that matter.

That is. Therefore the Brahman himself said:
