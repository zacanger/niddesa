down": "The Lord is a person who has meditation. He who has meditation in the
first jhana is a meditation; he who has meditation in a second jhana is also a

is dust... (omitted) All unwholesome deeds are dust. Those dust has been cut off
for the Buddha and the Blessed One, and the roots have been cut off, just like a

therefore, the Buddha is the one who has no dust, the one who is free from the
dust, the one who has produced the dust, the one who has thrown away the dust,
the one who has abandoned the dust, the one who has left the bound of the dust
(the one who does not correspond to the dust), and the one who has overcome all
the dust.

person who has left the dust.

person who has left the dust.

should not be done have been cut off, and the roots have been cut off, just like
a palm tree without roots. Non-existence is something that will not be born in
the future. Therefore, the Buddha should be the author.

"For those who have not spread, for the monks who have cut off the stream,

the scorching heat is not found. [Sn.3.11,720 verse]'

four kinds of troubles: the troubles of desire, some troubles, the troubles of
seeing, and the troubles of ignorance. Those troubles have been abandoned for
the Buddha and the Blessed One. , The root has been cut off, just like a palm

person who has fallen into a state, a person who has practiced... (omitted) The
cycle of life and death, without his rebirth. "All Dhamma have reached the other
side."

want to ask questions, and I come if I want to hear questions." This is where
the needy comes with questions. Or, "the inquiries that belong to the question
have the need, the one who wants to ask the question, the one who wants to hear,
[there will be] the needy come, approach, approach, visit." This is also the
need to come by the question . Or, "When you have a question, you can and you
