32. I saw all the Brahman actors in heaven and the world of men, (there are no Brahman actors??)
I respect (salute??) you, you are all eyes (??), Shakyamuni! Please free me from doubts.

"I saw in heaven and the world of men": "Heaven", there are three kinds of
heaven: secular heaven, reborn heaven, and pure heaven. What is secular heaven?
Kings and princes and queens are called secular heavens. What is the rebirth?
The Four Kings, Thirty-Three Heavens, night days, day of the day, free days
(??), all Brahma heavens, and all the heavens above that are called Rebirth
Heavens. What is pure heaven? [Tathagata,] The troubles of the disciples of the
Tathagata have been exhausted. Arahats and Fanzhu (??) Bhikkhu Buddhas are
called pure heavens. The Blessed One is the heaven of the secular and the
departed heaven (??), the heaven of the pure heaven, the victorious heaven, the
heaven among the heaven, the lion among the lions, the dragon among the dragons,
the lord among the lords, the muni among the munis, the king among the kings. "I
see in the heavens and in the world of man": "In the world of man I see the
heavens (??); I see the superior heaven; I see the heaven in the heaven, I see,
I watch, I meditate, I observe." In the world of heaven and man.

"Brahman actors (doers) without possessions": ""No", no greed, no hatred,
...ignorance, sloth, seeing (sight), pollution, evil deeds; any of those who
treat the Buddha (for Buddha??) and the world (??), it has been cut off, and the
roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming
non-existent and immortal for the future. Therefore, the Buddha is called no
owner (not owner of these things??). "Brahman", the Blessed One is the Seven
Dhammas, the excluded state is Brahman (the Blessed One is the excluded state of
the seven laws of Brahmin ??): seeing is excluded, suspicion is excluded,
abstinence.., greed..., aversion, ignorance, sloth, and those evil and
unwholesome dhammas are excluded: those that are polluted, there are again.
People who are fearful, who suffer the consequences, and will die in the future.

[Blessed One:] [Sn.3.6, 524 verses]

"After all evil is eliminated, the state where the decontaminated good enters
the concentration standing (dwelling),
He transcends samsara and becomes a consummation (hero??). Those who are not dependent,
like this can be called a Brahman. "

"Actor", walker, doer, dweller, turner, guardian, and survivor. "A Brahmin
actor who has nothing.

"I respect you, you are all eyes": ""You", he said the world-honored. "I
respect", I respect with my body, or I respect with words, or I respect with my
heart, or I respect in its meaning, or I follow the Dhamma to show respect,
salute . "All eyes", all eyes are called the state of all knowing wisdom. The
Blessed One arrives (has) (??), the state of intelligence of fully reaching
(having), entering, fully entering, having enough, having all the knowledge.

"For him, there is nothing unseen here (in this world), there are still
unknowable, unknowable things (there are _no_ unknowable things??), He proves
that everything that exists should be guided, because the Tathagata is like that
for all eyes. (as it is for all eyes??)"" [Ps.1, paragraph 121]

I salute you, you are all eyes.

"Sakyamuni! Please free me from doubts": "Sakyamuni", "Sakyamuni is a monk from
the house of Sakya." This is Sakyamuni. Or, "the rich, the wealthy." This is
also Shakya. For him there are these wealth, namely: trusting wealth, abstaining
from wealth, ashamed of wealth, hearing about wealth, giving wealth, wisdom
wealth, mindfulness of wealth, righteous wealth, divine wealth, root wealth,
strength wealth, enlightenment wealth, Path wealth, Fruit wealth, Nibbana
wealth, and use these various treasures as (for??) the rich, the wealthy. Or,
"Those who are possible, those who are able, those who flow out all kinds of
things, those who are sufficient, those who are heroes, those who are brave,
those who are heroic, those who are not timid, those who are not frightened,
those who do not run away, those who have given up fear of fear, those who have
given up terror and fear." Also Sakyamuni. Doubts are called doubts: doubt on
suffering, doubt on the path leading to suffering, doubt on the foreground,
doubt on the background, doubt in the context of the context (??), the doubt in
the specific conditional condition (??), such doubts, suspicions, doubtful
states, confusion, hesitation, crossroads, inconsistent grasping, hesitating,
incomplete understanding, stiff state, confusion of mind. "Sakyamuni! Please
free me from doubt": "Please free me; please release me; pull me out; please
pull me out completely; bring me out of doubt." Sakyamuni! Please free me from
doubts.

33. I will not be able to liberate you: Dudag! Anyone who doubts in the world,
When you know the best way, then you will get through this storm.

"I will not be able to liberate": "You, I will not be able to release, free,
make liberated, pull out, pull out completely, make to ascend, make to fully
ascend, in a doubtful arrow state (of being struck with the arrow of doubt??).
"I will not be able to liberate". Or, "I don't work hard on the unbelievers, on
the unwilling, on the slack, on those with inferior vitality, on the inactive; I
don't do my best; I don't strive; I don't do with valor; I don't work with
enthusiasm; I don't make fortitude; I don't make determination; I don't make
vitality; I don't make it produce; I don't make it appear; I don't make it fully
produced; I don't make it arise; I don't make it give birth to the teachings of
the Dhamma." This is also incapable of liberation. Or, "You don't have any other
liberators. Those who can be liberated use their own fortitude, with their own
energy, with their own striving, with their own brave efforts, with their own
power, with their own human power, with their own human vitality, with their own
work, with their own correct way of doing, following the path, not going the
opposite way, the way of following the Dhamma, and the way of doing the Dhamma,
they can be freed." This is also the way I will not be liberate you.

This was said by the Blessed One: "Chunta (Pure??)! "I am the one who has fallen
into the quagmire and will pull out the other people who have fallen into the
quagmire." This is impossible. Chunta! "I am an unregulated, untrained,
non-Nibbana one. I will make others tune, train, and attain Nibbana." This is
impossible. [MN.8]" This is also being incapable of liberating you.

This is said by the World Honored One: [Dph.12,165偈]
"He has done evil, he is polluted,
He who does do not do evil, he comes pure,
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure."
This is also not being able to liberate you.

This was also said by the Blessed One: "Similarly, Brahmin! Nibbana stays and
stands, which leads to the way of Nibbana stays and stands (?? Nibanna lived,
guided by the way of Nibbana??). My persuasion stays (My advice to live??).
However, when my disciples are taught and admonished in this way, some of them
have reached the ultimate end Nibbana, but some will not arrive, Brahmin! What
can I do here? Brahmin! Tathagata is the waypointer. [MN.107] Buddha only tells
(guides) the way, and they can be liberated when they practice it by
themselves." This also is not being able to liberate you.

"Any doubter in the world": "A doubter, a person who has doubts,
confusion, and hesitation. "Any (person)", any Kshatriya, or Brahman, or
Vaisha, or Sudra, or layman, or monk, or heaven, or person. "In the world", in
the world of the suffering world... (omitted). Any doubter in the world.

"When knowing the most triumphant Dhamma": "The highest Dhamma is called
immortality, Nibbana, which is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of
all attachments, the cessation of craving, greed, extinguishment, and Nibbana.
"Supreme, the first, the most victorious, the extraordinary, the highest,
the most advanced method; when knowing, distinguishing, understanding,
through." When knowing the most winning method.

"This way you will get through this storm": "Such a storm of desire, the storm
of seeing, the ignorant, you can get through, you can surpass, you can you can
overcome the storm. "For this you will get through this storm.

34. Brahman! The compassionate person asks, teach me, I can learn to stay
away from the Dhamma (??),
I am like the harmless person in the void, here I can walk silently and
unstoppable.

"Brahmin! Please teach the commandment for the compassionate": ""Brahmin! Please
teach the commandment; Brahman! Please help; Brahman! Please be merciful."
Brahman! Please teach the commandment. "The compassionate person", The
compassionate, the sympathizer, the protector, the funder, the compassionate."
Brahmin! The compassionate person asks you to teach.

"I can get away from the Dhamma that I can know": "Away from the Dhamma is
called immortality, Nibbana, that is the cessation of all actions, the cessation
of all attachments, the extinction of craving, greed, extinction, and Nibbana.
"I can Knowing", I can know, know, dissociate, know for sure, understand, prove,
reach, and testify." For I can know, stay away from the Dhamma.

"I am like the innocent person of the void": "If the void is not stuck, not
captured, not tied, not tied to the world, then it is the one who is not stuck,
not captured, and not tied , The one who is not bound by all over." This is like
a person who has no evil in the void. "If the emptiness is not dyed with
carmine, or golden yellow, or indigo, or deep red [color], then the one who is
not dyed, the one who is not angry, the one who does not change foolishly, and
the one who does not pollute." This is also like the emptiness of the emptiness.
The victim. "If the void does not get angry, is not abusive, does not resist,
and is not attacked, this is the one who is not angry, the one who is not
abusive, the one who does not resist, the one who is not attacked, and the one
who does not fight back." This is also like the absence of the void By.

"Just here you can walk silently and unrestrainedly": ""Just here silently",
"when you are here; when you are here; when you are sitting here; when you are
sitting on this seat ; It's when sitting down among the crowd." This is just
here silently. Or, "Just here is silent, silent, calm, cooled, stopped." This is
also here silent There are two kinds of dependence in the "non-resistance
ground": the dependence of craving and the dependence of seeing... (Omitted)
This is the dependence of craving... (Omitted) This is the dependence of
seeing... Thirsty After the dependence of love has been cut off, and the
dependence of seeing has been cut off, it becomes the non-dependant of the eyes,
the non-reliant of the ear, the non-reliant of the nose, the non-reliant of the
tongue, and the non-reliant of the body, Those who do not depend on the mind,
the colors... the sounds... the smells... the tastes... the touches... the
dhammas... the family... the group (the crowd)... the residence... the
benefit... the reputation... the praise ...Les...Clothes...Food...Dwelling...The
patient's needs and medical necessities...The Desire Realm...The Color
Realm...The Colorless Realm...The Desire to Be...The Colorless To...Want to
Have... ...There is no desire to exist...there is no desire to exist...the one
aggregate has...the four aggregates have...the five aggregates have...the
past...the future...now...is what you see, hear, feel, and can be known Those
who do not adhere to, those who do not adhere to, those who do not fall into,
those who do not adhere to, those who do not turn their minds toward (victory).
Those who have left, have given up, have been freed, have been separated from
the bondage, he is separated The heart of limitation [to live]. "Can do", can
do, can live, can act, can turn [, can guard], can survive, can survive."
Because it is here to be able to quietly, not rely on Ground line.

Summary:

1. Rely on one's own efforts (being enthusiasm = bravery, enthusiasm, fortitude,
   determination, vitality, desire) to liberate instead of the Blessed One (the
   Blessed One is the one who guides the way and cannot make liberation).

2. Know that after dyeing, don't be thirsty for all kinds of things ⇒ can spend
   love in the world.
