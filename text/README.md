The Pali directory is for future reference.
The book directory is semi-complete.
I'm first working through the translations from the Chinese, then checking
against the Sinhala.
Unclear lines and words are marked with `??`. Unclear verses and sections are
marked with a `TODO:`.
Places where I've written `(omitted, see previous sections)` are intended to be
filled out from the previous sections once the translation is solid.
