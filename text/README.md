The Pali directory is for future reference.
The generated-translations directory is files I haven't touched yet.
The book directory is translations that have been at least somewhat
cross-checked and edited.

I'm going about this by first working with the translations from the Chinese,
since those are more readable, and then by checking that result with the
translations from Sinhala.

Unclear lines and words are marked with `??`. Unclear verses and sections are
marked with a `TODO:`.
