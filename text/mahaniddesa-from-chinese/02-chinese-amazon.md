12. you see! The throbbers treat things as their own, such as fish in a little
    water that is depleted,

After seeing this, I should also do nothing: not being a follower in there.

"Look! The throbbing bears things as their own": "I do", there are two kinds of
things I do: I do the [because of] the thirst, which I do with the [cause] see.
What is thirsty love I do? All are called as boundaries, as realms, as bounds,
bounds, clutched, taken as their own: This is mine, this is mine, so much is
mine, so much is mine, this is mine, so much is mine, and this is The range is
mine; my color, voice, smell, taste, touching, spreading things, coats, maid and

warehouses, warehouses, all the earth, because of thirst for love and treat them
as their own, all one hundred and eight kinds of thirsty love tide [AN.4.199],
this is my thirst love Performs.

What is seeing what I'm doing? There are twenty personal opinions, ten
wickedness, ten sidelines, and ten sidelines, such as such see, evil opinion,
jungle, desert, distorted, shaken, bound, seppling, acceptance, Hold, perform,
clamp, upside down (vipariyesa) clamp, upside down (vipariyesa) clamp, upside
down (vipallāsa) ) Clenchment of the wicked, the clasping of evil, "[seen] as
true in non-true" clenched, all came to the place of 62 evil views, thisSee what
I do. "Look! The throbbers treat things as their own": "They are throbbing when
they are robbed, when they are robbed, when robbed, they also throb when they
have been robbed; being treated as their own fear becomes easy When they are
throbbing, they also throb when they become easy, and when they have become
easy, they also throb, strong throbbing, throbbing completely, expand throbbing,
trembling, trembling, trembling, big trembling, so, when throbbing, strong
throbbing, completely When you expand throbbing, trembling, trembling,
trembling, and trembling, behold, see you, see you, watch, and observe. For you
guys to see! The throbbers treat things as their own.

"If fish are in a little water that is depleted": "If fish are in a little
water, little water, water depleted by crows or eagles or cranes attacked,
raised, eaten, they throbbed, strong throbbing, completely throbbing, expanding
Throbbing, trembling, trembling, trembling Similarly, people (generations) are
treated as their own fears of being robbed, when they are robbed, when they are
robbed, when they have been robbed, and when they are taken; when fears become
their own things become easy. Throbbing, they also throb when it becomes easy,
and when it becomes easy they also throb, strong throbbing, throbbing
completely, expanding throbbing, trembling, trembling, trembling, trembling. For
such as fish in a little water that is depleted.

"I should do nothing after seeing this": 'This oversuffering: after I have seen
him, after seeing, after seeing, after measuring, judging, after division, and
after figuring it out. ' After seeing this. There are two kinds of things I do:
[because of] the thirst of love I do with me, which I have seen. ... This is
what I do with thirsty love... This is what I see. After giving off my thirst
and love; after the discerning of what I do, he [holds] not eyes as his own;
does not take ears as his own; does not take the nose as his own; does not treat
tongue as his own; does not treat himself as his own Do not think of their own;
all colors... sounds... smells... all tastes... all touches... family... groups
(public)... shelter... reputation... praise... music... Clothes... food...
shelter... patient's needs and medical necessities... desires... color
circles... colorless... want to have... colorless... I want to have... ... one
has... four has... five... the past... the future... now... does not see, smell,
feel, can be known as his own, he [keep] not holding, not practicing, not
persisting He should do, should live, should act, should turn, should guard,
should make survival, should make survival." In order to see this, I should do
nothing.

"Not in there as a follower": "In there", in the middle of desire, in color, in
colorless. Persistent is called thirsty love, that is greed, lust... (medium)
greed, greedy, bad roots. "Do not be a beloved in there": "In there - obsession
- not author; willed, love, greedy, like the unauthor, the person who does not
  make it born, not born, not born, not born." To be a follower who is not in
  there.

Because then, Worldman said:

"Look! The throbbers treat things as their own, such as fish in a little water
that is depleted,

And after seeing this, I should do nothing: not a follower in there."

13. on both sides of the revolt after the desire, all known after the touch of
    lush

Whoever rebukes himself, he does not perform it, and the wise is not
contaminated in what he saw and smell (Ceylon Edition).

past is one side, the future is the second side; pleasure as one side, suffer
for the second side; named side, color for the second side; six inside On one
side, the six outside is the second side; there is a body, and a body set as the

gather, destroy, taste, overkill, too sick, out, this is a measure of all known.

What is disconnection? And after this measure, the desire of the touch is cut
off, discarded, and ended, and made it to be absent. This is said by Worldman,
"The Bichu And whosoever is about the desire and greed of the touch shall be cut
off, so that it shall be cut off, and the root shall be cut off, like a palm
tree without roots, into a non-living thing for the future. [SN.22.25] 'This is

the touch of greedy.

"Whosoever rebukes himself does not do it": "Whosoever is all." "Rebuke
Yourself," rebuke yourself for two reasons: what was done and what was not done.
What is he rebuked himself for what was done and what was not done? "The evil
deeds that I have done, not by me." He rebuked himself, "I did evil, and did not
do good by my words." He rebuked himself, "The evil deeds which I did, and did
not do good by what I did." He rebuked himself; for what I did to kill, not by
which I did. He rebuked himself, 'Being taken not given by what I did, and not
by what I did not give. ' He rebuked himself: 'The evil of which I did, and
which I did not quit wickedness. ' He rebuked himself: "I have made the false
words, and I have not forbened them." He rebuked himself: "I have made the
disguise, and I have not been forbent from it." He rebuked himself: "The crude
evil words which I made, which I made, have not been abused by me." He rebuked
himself: "The unclean words which I made, and the unholy words which I made were
not absent." He rebuked himself: "Greed by me, not greed by me." He rebuked
himself, "The evil which I did, and not I did without evil." He rebuked himself;
'The evil that I made, did notI made the positive view. He rebukes himself, so
that he rebukes himself for what was done and what was not done. Or, 'I'm not
all branches on my ring. ' He rebuked himself, 'I am not a guardian of the root.
' He rebuked himself, 'I'm not the right amount of diet. ' He rebuked himself,
'I am not a sober man. ' He rebuked himself, 'I am not a man of reading and
righteousness. ' He rebuked himself, 'Four thoughts were not practiced by me. '
He rebuked himself, 'Four is not practiced by me. ' He rebuked himself, 'The
four gods were not practiced by me. ' He rebuked himself, 'Five were not
practiced by me. ' He rebuked himself, 'Five forces were not practiced by me. '
He rebuked himself, 'Seven feusions were not practiced by me. ' He rebuked
himself, 'Eight sacred paths were not practiced by me. ' He rebuked himself,
'Suffering is not known to me. ' He rebuked himself, 'The set was not cut off by
me. ' He rebuked himself, 'The way was not practiced by me. ' He rebuked
himself, 'I have not testified. ' He rebukes himself, so he rebukes himself for
what was done and what was not done, so he rebuked his own heritage for not
performing, not born, not born, not born, not born, not born." He does not
perform it for whosoever rebukes himself. "The wise ones are not contaminated in
what they see and smell": "There are two kinds of adhesion: [because] the
adhesion of love [because] and [because] see... (medium) This is the adhesion of
thirsty love... Adhesive. "Wise" is the wise, the wise, the wise, the wise, the
different, the wise, the wise, the wise, after giving off the adhesion of his
thirst, after the adhesion of the discernment, shall not be contaminated in
sight; not contaminated in what they smell; in Feel not contaminated; in the
sense of non-pollution, not strong pollution, not close (no pollution), no
pollution, no pollution, no strong pollution, no close pollution. He has
departed, departed, liberated, and has been bound, and he dwelt away from the
restrained heart. The wise ones are not contaminated in what they see and smell.

Because then, Worldman said:

"On both sides of the revolt, they know that they have no desire behind the
touch,

Whoever rebukes himself, he does not perform it, and the wise is not
contaminated in what he saw and smell (Ceylon version)."

14. know that after trying to get more plunge, in all things Muni is not

spoilt, calamity, evil, evil, terror, evil, the moving, easy Bad... (Medium) He
made it measured by gathering, exterminating, fun, oversuffering, and departing.
This is the measurement is well known.

What is disconnection? When measured in this way, about desire, greed him off,
departs, [to end,] to make it non-existent. For this is said by the Worldmen,
"The Bichu And whosoever is about desire and greed, you shall be cut off, so
that it shall be cut off, and the root is cut off, like a palm tree without
roots, into a non-living thing for the future." [SN.22.25] This is cut off all
over. "Knowing after thinking", these three kinds of know all over the thought.
"The more the torrents", the torrents of desire, some of them, the torrents
seen, the outflow of unknown, he can pass, can pass, can pass, can overcome."
For all to think can be more torrents.

Muni bits (perfect virtue): Muni-bit, Muni-language, imuni bit.

What is a Muni-bit? Three kinds of evil deeds to be the Muni; three kinds of
good deeds are the Muni; in the body of wisdom as the Muni; the body is known as
the Muni; andThe road is the Muni bit; about the desire and greedy to be a Muni
position; the fourth Zen of the [income] extinction of the fourth Zen to be the

Six types of Munii have these three methods: "Munii at home, homeless muni,
learning Muni, no school Muni, no school Muni, and Muni [of the] Muni." Which
are at home Muni? Those who saw the footsteps, and had known the commandments in

Seven kinds of learning to learn Munii, Arrohan for no school Muni, Buddha for a
pig Muni, Muni [in] Muni is known as Rulaii, Alohan, all the positive feeling.

"Not to Mune (silence) as a Mune, an unwise man of disshape,

After lifting the scale, take the top and become a wise person.

Avoiding the evil, that Muni became Munie because of that.

Whosoever understands both [inside and outside] in the world, because that is
said to be Muni.

Knowing the law of the bad and the good in all the world, both inside and
outside,

He is Muni after being fed by heaven and man, and beyond the dyed net."

There are two kinds of adhesion: [because of] love adhesion and [because] see
adhesion... (medium) This is the adhesion of thirsty love... (medium) This is
the sticking of see. Munier's thirst after the adhesion of love, after the
disbelief of the adhesion, in all objects is not contaminated, not strong, not

Because then, Worldman said:

"We all know that after the more plunge, in all things Muni will not be
polluted,

The stabbed arrows have been pulled out of the unleased, and did not desire this
world and the other.

The cave eight sets of instructions for the second [Completed].
