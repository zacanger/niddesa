The Pali directory is for future reference.
The generated-translations directory is files I haven't touched yet.
The book directory is translations that have been cross-checked and edited, or
are currently in progress.

I'm going about this by first working with the translations from the Chinese,
since those are more readable, and then by checking that result with the
translations from Sinhala.
