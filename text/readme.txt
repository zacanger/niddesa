I'm going about this by first comparing the translations from the Chinese and
trying to get something okay out of those, since they turned out much better
than the translations from Sinhala. Going file-by-file, line by line. Once those
are rectified and edited together, I'll do the same thing using that result as a
base and each of the translations from Sinhala to fix things up. Since I have
multiple Pali transliterations too, those could come in handy where words or
lines don't seem to make any sense. So the first goal is to get through the cnd
translations from the Chinese, then mnd from the Chinese, then the same but with
the translations from Sinhala on top of the fixed-up Chinese-based translation.
