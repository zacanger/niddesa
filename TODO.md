First edition:
* Try to have the first edition ready by Vesak!
* Full re-reading edit pass to clean up odd phrases and so on
* Fix epub thinking each verse number is the start of a list
  * Escaping, other list formats, other non-list formats, unordered lists with
    numbers in the list, etc., don't seem to fix this. An alternative might be
    using the HTML to generate the epub, but that is not ideal.
* Unignore the assets dir and index.html and turn on GH pages
* Comment on related forums, wikipedia, etc when it's published

Second edition:
* Consider filling in all areas marked `omitted, see previous sections` — this
  would make a much longer book, but may be worth doing anyway.
* Go back and compare section by section with the Pali and with the
  Paramatthajotikā
