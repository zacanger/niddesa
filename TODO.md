First edition:
* Full re-reading edit pass to clean up odd phrases and so on
  * In progress, started with CND, look for checkpoint comment
* Unignore the assets dir and index.html and turn on GH pages
* Comment on related forums, wikipedia, etc when it's published
* Try to have the first edition ready by Vesak!

Second edition:
* Consider filling in all areas marked `omitted, see previous sections` — this
  would make a much longer book, but may be worth doing anyway.
* Go back and compare section by section with the Pali and with the
  Paramatthajotikā
