* Fix issues marked with `??`
* Add accents and diacritics to Pali words, and fix Sanskritized and Sinicized ones
* Fill in spots marked `omitted, see previous sections`
* When a first edition is ready:
    * Unignore the assets dir and index.html and turn on GH pages
    * Comment on related forums, wikipedia, etc
* Fix epub thinking each verse number is the start of a list
  * Escaping, other list formats, other non-list formats, unordered lists with
    numbers in the list, etc., don't seem to fix this. An alternative might be
    using the HTML to generate the epub.
