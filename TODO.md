Ideas for rewriting with assistance from an LLM

* [Tutorial for getting a generic model with one lang with tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train)
* [Tutorial on making a translation model](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter7/4?fw=tf)
* Look through HuggingFace model registry for anything that knows Sanskrit, since grammar and syntax are similar, to fine-tune
* Check in on that one Chinese guy who had a sort-of working ML thing working for Pali, maybe it's just good now, who knows (fork of BuddhistNexus?)

The goal here is to go from Pali, not some intermediate lang, though Thai or Sinhala might still be useful for tricky bits. The goal is _not_ to learn Pali, or to spend thousands on cloud costs. If it's not tenable, it can wait until the tech is good enough, or I retire, or someone else picks it up. This book really is not important enough to get stressed out over (and if I'd known that before I did v1, I might not have done v1).

Old notes:

* Then try the sinhala again, see if there's anything useful there
* Then, retranslate from the thai, integrate
* Then check out other people's machine translation work
