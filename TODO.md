This branch (feat/pub) is specifically for prepping for publication on
suttacentral.net's Bilara system. I'm 90% sure I can automate building files in
the correct format rather than doing it manually, which is definitely desirable
considering I also plan on doing an in-depth revision sometime in 2023 based on
the Thai versions. The easy part will be creating translation/en/*; the
difficult parts will be /comment/ and /html/.

The repo to submit the data is at https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data

Format information is available in that repo and its wiki.
