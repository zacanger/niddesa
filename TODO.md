* Fix verse lines â€” most of them put two lines on the same line
  * cnd done
* Fix issues marked with `??`
* When a first edition is ready:
    * Unignore the assets dir and index.html and turn on GH pages
    * Comment on related forums, wikipedia, etc
* Fix epub thinking each verse number is the start of a list
  * Escaping, other list formats, other non-list formats, unordered lists with
    numbers in the list, etc., don't seem to fix this. An alternative might be
    using the HTML to generate the epub, but that is not ideal.
