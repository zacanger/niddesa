Phra Suttantapitaka, Volume 22, Khuddaka Nikaya, Chulanittes, bowing to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the fully enlightened Buddha, Parayanavak, the object of the Brahmin Pawari, sent his disciples to ask questions.

[1] Brahmin Pavari is a learner of mantras. Desire to be carefree Leaving the delightful Phra Nakhon Kosol To Thakhina - rural areas 
[2] The Brahmins were on the banks of the Godavari River. which is the border of the region of Asaka and the region of Mulka Live a life by visiting monks and fruits. 
[3] When that brahmin entered (inhabited) a large village with the prosperity born from that house. The Brahman worshiped the Mahayana
[4]. The Brahman worshiped the Mahayana and returned to the Hermitage. when the brahmin returned Another brahmin came. 
[5] The other brahmins, with crippled feet, stuttering, stumped teeth, with dust on their heads, have approached Pawri. Asking for five hundred wealth. 
[6] Pavaree the Brahman saw that Brahman had entered. was invited to sit then asked about happiness and disease and said this saying:
[7] Our wealth is to be given. We've given up. Behold the Brahmin, believe me. Our five hundred wealth is nonexistent. 
[8] If when we ask You usually don't give. On the seventh day your head shall be broken into seven pieces. 
[9] A brahmin is a liar. Embellish the cause for fear. Brahmin Pavari had heard the Brahmin's words. is suffering. 10 is pierced by an arrow of sorrow. If you don't eat food, you will become slim. Yes, but only. The mind of a Brahmin who has such a mind does not delight in worship. 
[11] Deva (who resided near the ashram of Brahmin Pawari) who wished for benefits Seeing Pawari Brahman in fear and suffering So he approached the Brahmin Pawri and said,
[12] A brahmin, who is in need of wealth, is a liar, does not know his head. The knowledge of the head or the dharma that the head falls off does not exist for the brahmin.
[13] This angel might know now. (said) I have asked. Please tell me the head and the dharma that cause the head to fall to me. I will listen to your words.

[23] frequent appearances of the Blessed One It is hard to find in the world. Today, the Blessed One has arisen in the world. A name appears: Lord Buddha. Hurry up to Savatthi and see the Supreme Lord Buddha. 
[24] O brahmin So how do we know that he is a Buddha? we How to know that Lord Buddha by deception? Please tell the plot to us who do not know. 
[25] Well, a great man with 32 characteristics, in all the mantras you have already stated completely and clearly. 
[26] Whoever has such a great man in his body That person had only two mottos. There is no third motto.

[28] and if that person is ordained as a monk will become an Arahant, fully enlightened Buddha There is a passion like an open roof, no one is greater. 
[29] Brahmin Pavari (said) the birth, clan, character, and other mantras for his disciples (said). You ask about the head. and only the Dharma that causes the head to fall with the heart. 
[30] If that person were to be a Buddha who saw the Dharma without any barriers. When you have asked a question with your heart It will be solved verbally.

[38] Pava, Bhokha Nakorn, Vesali, Magadha and Pasana chedi which are sacred places. delightful. 
[39] Those brahmins hurried up to the mountains. (Pasan Chedi) Like a thirsty man, he hurries to find cold water. like a merchant in a hurry to find great fortune and like a person who has been scorched by heat and hastened to find an umbrella, therefore. It was as if the lion was in the forest. 
[41] Achit Brahman saw the Lord Buddha who was just as the sun had radiated. and like the full moon on the full moon day.
[42] Then the brahmin Achit stood at a certain point. rejoicing because he saw the full number of consonants in the body of the Blessed One He asked the question with his heart.
[43] A.D., who did you specify? Tell the nation, tell the clan along with the characteristics. Tell the success in all the mantras. Brahmins teach Manop how much? 
[44] The Brahmin was 120 years old, named Pawri by his clan. There are three characteristics inherent in that brahmin. The Brahmin is the one who has reached the shores of the Triphet.
[45] The Brahmin of the Brahmin of his achievements in the Dharma teaches five hundred Manvas in the manner of a great man. and the Book of Itihasa along with Scriptures and Scriptures 
[46] Lord Most High than the people. Who cuts off cravings, declare the breadth of all natures. of Brahmin Pawari. Do not doubt us.
[47] That brahmin conceals his face with his tongue. There is warmth in between the eyebrows. And there are organs hidden in the cloth in the sheath. Look at Karma, thou shalt know this. 
[48] ​​All the people did not listen to anyone. which is the questioner hearing all the problems that the Blessed One had solved and rejoicing Pranam Anchalee thinks differently (that) 
[49] Who is the deity, the Brahma, or the Sujambdi Indra? When he asked the question with his heart Who can solve the problem? and the dharma that causes the head to fall. O the Blessed One who seeks May the Lord prophesy that verse. Put away our doubts. 
[51] P.S. You know that Avijja is the head Wijja coupled with faith, mindfulness, concentration, chanda and viriya are the dharmas that cause the head to fall. 
[52] Then Ajitmanapa, who was supported by great joy, made a tiger's skin on one shoulder. then lay down on his head at the feet of the King (said) 
[53] O Lord of sorrow eyed person Brahmin Pavari, along with his disciples, had a joyful mind. Pay homage to His Highness.

[55] We give opportunity to the Brahmins, to you and to all Brahmins. Throughout all doubts. All of you desire any problem in your heart, so ask. 
[56] Achit Brahman sits with his hands together. and asked the first problem with the Tathagata in that company What's wrapped up? The world does not appear for what reason? What is the plaster on the world? What is the great danger of that world? 
[58] The word, which world is enclosed, means the world of hell, the world of beasts, the world, the evil world, the human world, the world of divinity, the world of aggregation, the world element, the world's shame, the world. This other world, the Brahma world, and the whole world this is called the world What is this world that conceals, covers, covers, covers, therefore, what is the name of this world? 
[59] The chapter that iti in the recital "Ijjasma achito" is a constituent chapter, it is a continuation chapter that completes the chapter. is a meeting of characters It is the refinement of the consonants, this iti follows the order of the chapters. The saying Aysma is a symbol of love. It is said with respect to the verse that this Aysma is a reference to go with respect and reverence. The word Achito is a name, a counting machine. It's a sign of knowledge, a commandment, a calling. as a naming as a nameplate It's a language called as a display device It is the specific speech of that brahmin, therefore it is called "Ijjasma achito". 
[60] Why does the word world not appear? That the world does not appear, is not bright, does not prosper, is not bright, is not clear, for what reason, therefore, is it called the world not appearing, for what reason? Ask him to say what is a plaster. is involved as a binder What is the world that is plastered, smeared, tainted, tainted, intermingled, entwined, intertwined? Speak, show, decree, appoint, reveal, classify, shallow, proclaim, therefore, what is the name? Paint that world? Ask him to speak. 
[62] What is the greatest danger of the world, what does it mean? is a squeezer It is a sarcasm, a dangerous tool, a stumbling block for that world, so what is the name of that world? because of that Then the brahmin said: (Ajitmanapa asked the question) What world is wrapped in it? The world does not appear for what reason? What is the plaster on the world? Please tell me. What is the great danger of that world? 
[63] (The Blessed One replied, "Dukrashita) The world of ignorance envelops it. The world does not appear because of our stinginess.
It is a plaster machine to paint the world. Suffering is the great danger of that world.
[64] Ignorance of suffering ignorance in all spheres ignorance in every nirvana ignorance in every nirodhakaminī ignorance at the beginning Ignorance in the End Ignorance in both the beginning and the end ignorance of the Dharma Dependence on each other arises, this is the factor of this Dharma called avijja, ignorance, ignorance, non-readiness. ignorance ignorance ready unsteadiness, unsteadiness, unsteadiness always disagreement disregard Inability to manifest, difficult to know, foolishness Ignorance with passion, passion, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, yoga.

The world of Pettivisa, the world of humans, the world of devas, the world of sages, the world-element, the embarrassed world, this world, the next world, the Brahma world, and the whole world of gods. This is called the world. This ignorant world is obscured, envelops, envelops, envelops, therefore is called the enlightened world envelops.

Father did not set His Highness did not set up His Highness did not set Friend and authority are not set. Blood relatives did not set up The ascetics and brahmins and gods were not set up. The name Bhagava is the name that arises at the end of liberation. The name Bhagava is the statute of limitations. Name of the Blessed One all who have enlightened with the attainment of omnipotence at the Great Bodhi Tree Therefore, it is called "Ajitati Bhagava".

This craving is the tool. is involved as a binder is the world's passion This lustful world is painted, plastered, tarnished, tarnished, tainted, intertwined, intertwined, intertwined.

[69] (Ashita asked:) Currents flow in all senses. What are the current barriers? May His Highness preach the Dharma as a barrier to all currents. What currents can be blocked? 
[70] The current is lust, the current is ditthi, the current is defilement, the current is corruption, the current is avijja, the stream in the Uthea is called "Savanti sabbhadhi sota", sabbadhi is in all senses. Savanti: It flows, it flows, it passes, it goes, it flows, it flows, it passes, it goes by sight, to the sound of the ear. In the nostrils, in the tastes of the tongue, in the bodily tactile, escaping, escaping, escaping, fading into the mind-dharma, lust flows, ebbs and flows, wanders, leads to the eye. … through the ear, lust goes … through the nose, lust goes … through the tongue, tactile lust goes … through the body, lust goes, goes, goes away, goes towards the mind. Therefore, it is called all currents. will flow in all senses. 
[71] The word Iti in the recitation of ijjasma achito is a continuation chapter. It is a complete chapter. is a meeting of characters It is the refinement of consonants. The word Iti follows the order of chapters. The saying Aysma is a sign of being with respect and reverence. The word Achito is a name, a counting machine. It's a sign of knowledge, a commandment, a calling, a name, a name. as a nameplate It's a language called as a display device It is a specific speech of that brahmin, therefore it is called “Ijjasma achito”.
[72] What word is a barrier against all currents? What does a barrier mean?
The prohibition device is a protective device. as a cure It is a protection device for all currents. hence the name What is a barrier to all currents? 
[73] The word, Lord, tell the Dharma as a barrier, that is, tell, show, command, appoint, reveal, classify, shallow, proclaim which Dharma is the barrier, which is Dharma. prohibition machine as a protection as a cure It is a protection device for all currents. That is why it is called, May the Lord preach the Dharma as a barrier to all currents. It can be concealed, that is, it cuts off, does not flow, does not shed, does not pass. Therefore it is called what currents can be closed? because of that Then the brahmin said: (Ajitmanava asked:) Currents flow in all senses. What are the current barriers? May His Highness preach the Dharma as a barrier to all currents. What currents can be blocked? 
[75] (The Blessed One replied: "Dukrashita) What currents in the world? Consciousness is a barrier to those currents. We say the Dharma as a barrier to all currents. These currents can be blocked by wisdom. 
[76] "Whatever currents in the world are these currents, I have said, I have said, I have said, I have said, I have decreed, I have appointed, I have revealed, I have classified, I have made shallow, I have declared, namely, currents of passion, currents of distrust, currents of defilement, currents of corruption, currents of ignorance. In the world, that is, in the world of ill-will, the world of mankind, the world of gods, the world of supremacy, the world-element, and the world of self-consciousness, therefore, what currents in the world are called. The Blessed One called that Brahman by the name Achita. 
[77] Remembrance is remembrance, specific remembrance, mindfulness, remembrance, sanity, non-passion. Unforgetfulness, sati, sati, sati samphojha, the Ekākānagaga (the path that leads only one person) is called sati, in the context of "sati tesam nivarana", this is called mindfulness. The word is a barrier, it means that it is a barrier, that is, a prohibition. It's a defense, it's a cure. It is a protection, therefore it is called mindfulness as a barrier against those currents. 
[78] I say the Dharma as a barrier to all currents, I say, I teach, I dictate, I appoint, I reveal, I classify, I make it shallow, I proclaim that the Dhamma is a barrier, it's a forbidden. as a protection It is a healer and a protection against currents. Therefore, we call the Dharma as a barrier against currents.
[79] All-knowledge, all-knowing action, etc. Sammaditthi is called wisdom, in the word paayete pithiyare. These currents which wisdom can block, meaning that these currents Wisdom can block it, that is, it cuts off, does not flow, does not flow, does not move, does not go. the wisdom of a person who knows All things are impermanent. inevitably blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows All sankharas are suffering. inevitably blocked ... not possible. The wisdom of a person who knows that all dharmas are selfless. inevitably blocked ... not possible. The wisdom of a person who knows that Because ignorance is a factor, there are sankharas that can block them … not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because sankhara is a factor, there is a spirit that can block it … not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because the spirit is a factor, there is a name and form, it can block it… it is impossible. these currents the wisdom of a person who knows because the name is a factor Therefore, there is a death inevitably blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because salayatana is a factor, there is contact, it can block it … it is not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because touch is a factor, there is feeling, it can block it … it is not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because feeling is a factor, there is desire, it can block it … it won't be possible. the wisdom of a person who knows because lust is a factor So there is a prejudice that can be blocked … not possible. These currents the wisdom of a person who knows Because clinging is a factor, there is a world inevitably blocking these streams the wisdom of a person who knows Because the world is a factor, there is a existence, which can be blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows because the nation is a factor So old and dead inevitably blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows Because of ignorance, sankhara is extinguished, because of body is extinguished, because of consciousness is extinguished, name and form are extinguished, because name and form are extinguished. The satanic then died. Because of the fading away, the contact is extinguished, because of the feeling is extinguished, because of the feeling is extinguished, because of the craving is extinguished. Prejudice therefore extinguishes. With the cessation of clinging, the existence is extinguished, because the existence is extinguished, because birth is extinguished, old age and death are extinguished. They can block, that is, they conceal, they do not flow, they do not flow, they do not move, they do not go. The wisdom of a person who knows this is suffering, this is suffering. This nirvana inevitably blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows these ashes This causes ashes this cessation This leads to the cessation of taints. inevitably blocked ... not possible. the wisdom of a person who knows These dharmas should be known. These virtues should be known These virtues should be ignored. These virtues should prosper. These virtues should be made clear. inevitably blocked ... not possible. The wisdom of a person who sees the birth, cessation, grace, blame, and deception is the veil of the six tangible senses, can be blocked ... not possible.
One who sees the birth, the cessation, the grace, the blame, and the devises of the five aggregates of clinging can block them … not possible. The wisdom of a person who sees the birth, cessation, blame, and deception is the source of the Great Formation. 4 can be blocked ... not possible. These currents the wisdom of a person who knows Something happens naturally. All things are naturally extinguished. They can block, that is, they conceal, they do not flow, they do not flow, they do not move, they do not go, therefore they are called flows that wisdom can block. because of that The Blessed One said, What currents in the world Mindfulness is the barrier to these currents, we say the Dharma is the barrier. These currents that wisdom can block 
[80] (Ashita asked) Where, O Lord, where does wisdom, mindfulness, and form disappear? I have inquired Please tell me that. 
[81] Clear knowledge, clear action. choice selection all over stipulation with stipulation specificity graduate wiseness, meekness Wisdom is the classification of thoughts, considerations, wisdom as the land. inward intellect, discernment, omniscient Wisdom pierced like a gore Wisdom is the strength Wisdom is just like a sword Wisdom is just like a castle Wisdom is only the light Wisdom is just a ray of light Wisdom is a lamp Wisdom is just the jewel, non-delusion, cultivating dharma, right mindfulness is called wisdom, in the context it's called "pva jeva sati japi", remembrance, remembrance, etc. Right-satisfaction is called sati. 
[82] The words "O Lord of Suffering" ... the name form is called the four imperial forms, the name of the four great elements, and the form based on the four great elements, the name Maris, which is said with love and respectfully says: This maris is said to go with respect and reverence, therefore it is called O Lord of suffering … form name. 'Phruhi' means that I ask, supplicate, invite, confer, 'Prutho' means I have asked, that is, supplicating, asking, conferring, 'Phruhi' means 'Please. Speak, tell, show, command, appoint, reveal, classify, shallow, preach, therefore I have inquired. Please tell me that. 
[84] The word Katthetam uparujjati means that it ceases, that is, it ceases, it does not settle, does not settle anywhere, therefore it is called that, wherever it ceases. Then the brahmin said, "O Lord, where does the suffering, wisdom, mind and form disappear? I have inquired Please tell me that thing. What problem have you asked? We will solve that problem for you. Name and form are extinguished, there is no rest; wherever name and form are extinguished there because of the cessation of spirit. Wisdom, mindfulness, and form name, apucci is to ask, come to ask, to supplicate, to invite, to be confiscated. Therefore, you have asked what problem you have asked.
[87] Utheat says, "Ajit tawatami te", the word "low" means wisdom, consciousness, and the noun form, "vatami" means that we will say, will tell, will show, will decree, appoint, reveal, classify, shallow, declare the problem, hence the name "Dukor". Chita, we will address that problem to you. 
[88] The four imperial forms are named in the context of "yattha, namca, rupaca, asesam, uparujchati", the four great elements, based on the four great elements, the name of the form, the word asesam. meaning that there is no remaining is all by all means All, by all means, no rest, no rest. The word asesa is a collective expression. "Uparujjati" means that it ceases, that is, it ceases to exist; therefore the name form ceases wherever it ceases. of the soul, whichever dharmas, namely name and form, should arise in sympathy And in the end that cannot be known, except for these seven states of existence, they cease, that is, they cease to exist, cannot be settled there, because of the cessation of consciousness by the Abhisankhara Dhamma. With Sotapatti Mortana. Whatever dharmas, namely name and form, should arise in the five worlds, except for the two, they cease, that is, they cease to exist, they cannot be settled there, because of the cessation of consciousness by the Abhisankhara-dhamma, by the Sakdakami way. Whatever dharmas, namely name and form, should arise in the kamma-element, the form-element, or the non-formal-element except the realm. Those dharmas are extinguished, that is, they are peaceful, they cannot be established, they are stopped there because of the cessation of consciousness by the Abhidhamma Dhamma. with an anatomical mind. Whatever dharmas, namely name and form, should arise, they cease, that is, they cease to exist, they cannot be settled there, because of the cessation of consciousness by the Abhisankhara Dhamma. With the enlightenment. When an arahant passes away through nirvana, these dharmas, namely wisdom, mindfulness, and name, form, they cease, that is, they cease to exist, they cease to exist, they cease there because of the former cessation of one's soul.

So, Sariputra, a bhikkhu has a mind freed. Sariputra, I say, "He is a great man, because he has liberated his mind. I do not say that he is a great man, because he is a believer. Therefore, I say, "I call that monk great man".

[283] The words "people in the world" say: Chanavadanti, Tayitam, Kathsu, namely, Brahmin kings, Phaes Sutras, Banpachit, gods, and humans. The word is said to be: Speaks, shows, dictates. The word Tayidang Kathsu is a question out of curiosity. It is a question with suspicion, a two-sided question, not a single-part question. This is the case. Or not like this? or how?

What is this? People refer to a person who possesses wisdom as a muni. Or is it that one who is endowed with existence is a muni?

Those who are wise do not speak … those who are pure in opinion. with pure listening With pure knowledge with comprehension, with eight properties, or with the wrong perception of being a muni, hence the name Duke Nanda, the wise … said … being a muni. a person without suffering There is no hope, wandering around. Those are muni, saying, Sena, corrupt body is Sana, corrupt speech is Sana. Corruption is a demon Lust is a villain, anger is a villain, a devil is a villain, anger is a hostility, blasphemy, equality, jealousy, stinginess, deceit, boastfulness, hardness, good competition, pride, contempt for you, drunkenness, negligence, all desires, all corruption. All the anxieties, all the fervor all the trouble All auksalaphisankharas are supreme. Kama said it was his first sena. Unpleasant said it was his second sana. Hunger and thirst he said is thy third sana. Lust tarn says it is thy fourth sana. Land of Mitta he said was his 5th Sana. Cowardice said that it was His 6th Sana. Wichichicha said that it was His Seventh Sana. His stubbornness was said to be His Eighth Sena. Your fortune, praise, reverence, rank that is wrongly acquired, is Sana. Exaltation and suppression of others are Sana. This is your guardian (The devil does not let you go out of power) He is the one who kills the Black Dharma. A person who does not dare will not be able to defeat that Sena. The brave can win When he is victorious, he receives happiness as follows. All pillars, all defilements, those who have won, lose, destroy, dispose of, turn away. escaped with the Four Noble Paths
At any given time, those people, I say, the one who has put away the sena. is suffering. those suffering Those who have been cut off, cut off, calmed, suppressed and prevented from happening. Burned with the fire, that is insight. Those people say that those who have no suffering, desire, lust, saraga, etc. Abhijha Lobha Akusolmun say that hope in the word nirasa is as follows. Hope is this craving. Those who are torn away ... burned. Then, by fire, that is wisdom, they say, Those who have no hope, I say: Those who have been swept away, have no suffering, no hope. Traveling to them is a muni, saying, I say … I declare that those who are arhats, who have been eliminated from their hosts, are free from suffering, have no hope, they travel, changing their posture, treating, nurturing and healing; they are muni in the world. hence the name We say that those who have swept away the sena a person without suffering Without hope, wandering, those people are muni.

[485] The word pleasure is its constituent as follows: Desire in impermanence says that pleasure is its complement. to know that karma that the island is connected by imperative desire, that is, to know, to know, to compare, to consider, to make it appear that desire in form is is involved a binding machine It's a worry machine. The word Iti is a chapter. Etc. The word Iti follows the order of the chapters. Therefore, it is called having pleasure as a constituent of this. 
[486] The word, having known that action thus, means knowing, knowing, comparing, considering, clarifying, making manifest. this already.

[489] Vusimato thus, that the name is a Brahman, because he has attained the seven qualities, etc. A person who is not dependent on desire and view, is steadfast, he is said to be a Brahmin. Therefore, he is called a brahmin. The term "End of the Brahma Life" means that the seven persons, including the gentlemen, dwell together, abide, and surround them in order to attain the dharmas that have not yet been reached. in order to attain the enlightenment that has not yet been achieved to inform which the Dharma that has not yet been made known The Arahant is finished. Completed the case Lay down the burden and gain the benefit that has already been reached. There is an end to the benefits in the world. The passion is over because I know it right. An arahant is endowed with the Dharma, has a well-behaved conduct, etc., does not have pity, that is, birth, old age and death, no further life, therefore it is called He is a brahmin, the holy life. Because of that Then the Blessed One said that, knowing that karma was the cause of the ignorance in the realm of existence, he had enjoyed it as a constituent. Then he contemplates (dharma) in that state. That is the true instinct of that person. which is a brahmin at the end of the holy life. along with the end of the spell, etc. The Blessed One is my teacher. I am a disciple. Thus ends. Posalmanavakhanawat Nittas. 14. Regarding the problem of Mr. Mokharat 
[490] (Mr. Mokharat asked): Lord Sakka Twice I have inquired. The Blessed One has not prophesied to me. I heard that The Blessed One is a hermit (Someone asked questions) For the third time, he prophesied. 
[491] The word "Sakka" Twice I have asked the question, saying that the Brahmin asked a question to the Enlightened One twice. The Blessed One asked a question. did not prophesy in the order of the eyes that The maturity of this brahmin's organic matter will exist. The Blessed One was named Sakka in the word Saka. hence his name is Sakka. The Blessed One is wealthy, having a lot of wealth, having a lot of wealth. even because of the following reasons therefore named Sakka. The Blessed One has these wealth: wealth is faith, property is morality. Wealth is Hiri Wealth is Ottappa wealth is suta Wealth is Jaka Wealth is wisdom, wealth is mindfulness. Property is a supplication Property is power Property is organic Wealth is strength, wealth is Bojjhana. Wealth is the path, wealth is the result, wealth is nirvana. The Blessed One is rich and has a lot of wealth. counted as having wealth with many jewels even because of the following reasons So he named him Sakka. The Blessed One is the valiant, the valiant, the able, the capable, the brave, the mighty, the progressive, the one who does not fear, the one who does not flinch, the one who does not flee, the fear of cowardice has not been abandoned. free from stupor even because of the following reasons therefore named Sakka, therefore named Sakka, I ... 2 times already. and asked, saying, O Venerable Sakka Twice I have asked, begged, invited, and asked for consecration, therefore my name is Lord Sakka. I have asked two times. The word Iti in the context says Ijjasma Mogharaja is a synonym. Etc. Aysma is a symbol of love. The word Mogharaja is a name and a calling of a brahman, therefore it is called Mogharaja asked: 
[492] The word did not prophesy to me, in the narration that it was Na Me phayakasi cakkuma, meaning did not speak. told ... did not announce to me. The word "eyesight" means that the Blessed One has eyes with five kinds of eyes, namely, human-eye-eyes, Dhipaya-sight, Wisdom-sight, Buddha-eyes-eyes, Samanta-eyes. How does the Blessed One have eyes even by human-eye? Five colors, namely green, yellow, red, black and white, appear to the Blessed One in the eye. Where is the eyeball located? There was green, good green, nice to look at, nice to admire, like the color of water hyacinths. Next to it, there is a nice yellow yellow color. Like the color of gold, nice to look at, admirable, like a yellow Kannikar flower.

Next to that, there was a white, good white, all white, bright white, nice to look at, nice to see, like the color of a sparkling star. The Blessed One It is normal for vegetarians to because of the image caused by honest karma in the previous life would see all the way around one benefit Both day and night. even when there is darkness Consisting of four elements, namely, the sun has set, on the waning night of the chapel, a line of dense forests, a large cloud has risen, and in the darkness composed of the four elements, at this time the Blessed One saw it all around. Holes, gates, walls, mountains, stumps, or vines are nothing to keep in sight of all forms. If a person were to take a sesame seed as a mark put it in a wagon for carrying sesame The person should take the sesame seed. Such is the normal eye of the Blessed One. How does the Blessed One have eyes even with this eye? The Blessed One considers the living beings, the incarnation, etc., with the pure vision of the human eye, thus he knows the beings who are bound by their karma. The Blessed One wishes to see the world.

One element is good, two is fine, three is fine, four is fine, five is fine, ten is fine, twenty is fine, thirty is fine, forty is fine, fifty is fine, a hundred is fine, a thousand is a minority. Two thousand is good, three thousand is good, and four thousand is good. or how much He wishes to see the world He saw only the elemental world. This is the pure eye of the Blessed One. How does the Blessed One have eyes even with this high vision? The Blessed One has great wisdom and wide wisdom. There is wisdom cheerful, wisdom is quick, wisdom is sharp, wisdom destroys desires, wise in the category of wisdom. have a broken mind He has attained the oath, has reached the 4th Vesarachayanana, the 10th power, is a valiant man. He was a man of color.

He has told the way that no one has told him, He knows the way, He knows the way, is wise in the way. That's it for now. The disciples were the ones who followed the path. Assembled later on. The Blessed One knows, the name knows, He sees, the name sees. He is wise, intellect, dharma, and has noble qualities. a preacher giving general advice bestowing immortality It is the Dharma that the husband goes like that. He did not know, did not see, did not know, did not make it clear. Not right, with wisdom, none at all. All dharmas, including past, future, and present, will come into the canal in the maze, the Enlightened One's insight. by all symptoms. It is reputed that any dharma verse that should be introduced and should be known exists. One's benefit, the benefit of others, the benefit of both sides, the benefit in this world. Benefits in the next life, shallow benefits, deep benefits, revealed benefits. secret benefit Recommended benefits Recommended benefits benefit without penalty benefits without passion white benefit or Especially useful. All of them will be within the Buddha's knowledge. all words all thoughts would be according to the spirit of The Blessed One who has attained enlightenment. The Enlightened One have the intellect that does not interfere in the past Future present. How much doctrine should be recommended? Only the wisdom, the more knowledge, the only Dharma that should be recommended. Phra Yarn has a dharma chapter that should be the most recommended. The dharma chapter that should be recommended has the supreme knowledge. The path of Dharma that should be recommended is not insulting the intellect. Those virtues are in the end of each other. Two tongues casing tightly together, lower tongue casing. not over the tongue tongue on top no more than the lower tongue, as the two slender tongues are situated at the end of each other, the Enlightened One. There is a Dharma that should be guided and the Wisdom is located at the end of each other. I'm the same. How much doctrine should be recommended? only the wisdom how much wisdom Only the Dharma should be recommended. Phra Yarn has a dharma chapter that should be the most recommended. The Dharma chapter that should be recommended is the most insightful. The enlightenment does not transcend the dharma that should be recommended. the path of the Dharma Recommendation is not invasive. Those virtues are in the end of each other. the insight of the Enlightened One It is possible in all dharmas. All dharmas because of avajjana, because of doubt because of the community due to malice of the Enlightened One, the Enlightened One It is possible in all animals. The Blessed One is aware of the supremacy as the place to lie down, to lie down, to lay down, to lay down, to lay down, to lay down, for all beings. He clearly knows that all beings with dust in their eyes are little wisdom. He who has defilements as dust as the dust in his eyes is very wise. with organic with weak organics, with good symptoms, with bad symptoms That which is easy to know, that which is difficult to know, which is the world of unfortunate beings, together with the worlds of the gods, the Mara, the Brahma worlds, together with the recluses, brahmins, devas and humans, will arise within the Buddha's knowledge. all kinds of fish and turtles Most of them include assorted timimit fish. Just as the world, with its gods, the Mara, the Brahma, and the beings, together with the recluses, brahmins, devas, and humans, will arise within the Buddha's knowledge. I'm the same. Most all types of birds including To Garuda, Ventoeyya flies in the air country, the disciples always Sariputra by wisdom would be in the country of the Buddha I'm the same. The Buddha's insight envelops the wisdom of gods and humans. King, Brahmin, householder, clergyman who is a graduate have detailed intelligence have a dialogue with others As an archer shoots sand, those sages are as though rambling with their own wisdom to destroy their views. Those sages who had developed problems came to see the Tathagata. Ask about those problems. The Blessed One has spoken and corrected. He has shown the cause and claimed the result. Those sages have reverence for the Blessed One. in that order The Blessed One grows even more with wisdom in that place. Therefore, the Blessed One is called How does the Blessed One have eyes even with the eye of the Buddha? The Blessed One examined the world with his eyesight. He saw in his eyes a group of lustful creatures with little wisdom He who has defilements as dust as the dust in his eyes is very wise. organic person The weak, the good, the bad The mentor is easy to know. The mentor is difficult to know. Some of them are normal people who see the dangers and dangers in the Hereafter. In the Koubon, in the Kopatum, or in the Kobuntharik Ubon green lotus flower Pathum Bua Luang or some types of white lotus flowers
grow in water, grow in water, go through water, drown in the water that nurtures. Some species are born in water and grow in water. always located in the water Some species are born in the water, grow in the water, emerge from the water. Even as the water nourishes The Blessed One examined the world with his eyesight. He saw in his eyes a group of lustful creatures with little wisdom He who has defilements as dust as the dust in his eyes is very wise. The brave, the weak, the good, the bad. The mentor is easy to know. Instructors are difficult to know. Some people normally see the dangers and dangers in the Hereafter. I'm the same. The Blessed One knows that This person is insane This person is a master. This person is deceitful. This person is insane. This person is a virtuous person. This person is instinct. The Blessed One speaks to a person who is enlightened, speaks mercy and meditates upon a person who is enlightened. He advises a person who is deceitful to settle because of ignorance and ignorance. in listening to the Dharma in the Dharma conversation in coexistence with the teacher. enlightenment of the Buddha's good enlightenment monks practice good and their precepts which is a vision a place of devotion to a person who is a virtuous person. Tell the symptoms are not noon. distress Anatta which is insight for a person who is instinctive. a person standing on the top of a rock mountain Just as the people around you should be seen, O Venerable Sumedha, His Highness ascended to the castle that was accomplished with Dharma. Without sorrow, he saw a people engulfed in sorrow. The nation and the old dominate advantage to me. The Blessed One has an eye, even with this eye of the Buddha. How does the Blessed One have an eye even with an eye? Sampanya, he said, "Samanta-Eye." The Blessed One enters, enters, enters, enters, enters and is fully omniscient. any dharma that the Blessed One has not seen unaware Or not know, not at all. The Blessed One knows only all the Dharma texts. Which butter is there? The Blessed One was aware of that chapter. because of that The Tathagata is therefore the Samatha Eye. The Blessed One has an eye even with such an eye. Therefore, he is called the Blessed One who has eyes. He did not prophesy to me. 
[493] The word I heard that The Blessed One who is a hermit (when someone asks a question) for the third time, he prophesied thus: that I had studied, remembered, and determined thus: Buddha who asked questions for the third time, he prophesied Did not prohibit. The word "Phra Thep Hermit" means that the Blessed One is both a deity and a hermit. hence the name Is a hermit. Just as the king was ordained, he was called a royal hermit, a brahmin ordained, and so was called a brahmin hermit. Therefore, it is called a hermit goddess. one more thing The Blessed One has been ordained. even because of the following reasons So he was called the hermit. The Blessed One seeks, seeks, seeks, seeks the great virtues Even because of this, he was called a hermit. The Blessed One seeks, seeks, seeks, seeks, finds great concentration, great wisdom. Great Wimuttikhan Wimuttinyan Tasson Khan Yai even because of the following reasons Therefore he is called a hermit. Withdrawing arrows is a big passion. loosening the big pile Falling only as a big flag great peace to shake off the great defilements big burden the great samsara cessation of great suffering To suppress the great fervor, to raise the Dharma as the flag rises. even because of that Therefore he is called a hermit. The great sympathy, the great power, the great organic matter, the great strength, the great Bojjhana, the Noble Eightfold Path, the great nirvana, even for the following reasons: Therefore, he was called the Hermit. The Blessed One, of all mighty beings, sought, sought, and found where the Lord Buddha resided. Where did the devas dwell? Where is the Blessed One, more valiant than the people, even because of the following reasons? Therefore, he was called a hermit. I heard that For the third time, the Blessed One who is a hermit (the one who asks questions) prophesies. because of that Then the brahmin said, O Lord Sakka I have inquired twice. The Blessed One has not prophesied to me. I heard that The Blessed One is a hermit (Someone asked questions) For the third time, he prophesied. 
[494] This world, the other world, the Brahma world and the god world would not know His opinion. The Kodom is an honorable person. 
[495] The word "this world" in the language is loko paro loko, thus it is the human world. The other world is the whole world. Take this world of mankind as another world, so it is called this world the other world. 
[496] The word Brahma world and the deva world means that the Brahma world with the deva world, Mara, the group of beings with ascetics and brahmins, devas and humans, hence the name Brahma world and the deva world. He does not know His views, decency, likes, doctrines, dispositions, and wills. Blessed One This has an opinion like this should be like this having such a liking have such a cult hospitable like this It is this will that is, therefore, does not know His opinion. 
[498] The word Gotama is a rank. Therefore, he had another rank. The Blessed One who is a god and man
He is revered, revered, revered, revered, revered, revered, given robes, alms, senasanas, and medicinal necessities, hence the name Gotama is a dignified person. because of that Then the brahmin said that this world, the other world, the brahma world and the god world would not know His opinion. The Kodom is an honorable person. 
[499] I have a need with a problem. So came to see him who saw this beautiful Dharma. When a person sees the world as the mortal does not see it. 
[500] The word one who sees this beautiful Dhamma means one who sees the beautiful Dhamma. see the supreme dharma see the supreme dharma see the wonderful Dharma see Dharma as the chairman He sees the Dhamma that is high, sees the Dharma very much. Therefore, he is called one who sees such a beautiful Dhamma. He is a person who has a need with a problem, therefore comes to see, etc., in order to clarify, to speak, even for this reason, therefore I have a need with a problem. So he came to see.
[502] "How does the word contemplate the world, how does one see, see, contemplate, compare, prosper, and make it clear? That's why it's called, how does one see the world?" He sees, does not experience, does not see, is not specific, therefore he is called mortal and therefore does not see. because of that Then the brahmin said that I had a need with a problem. So came to see him who saw this beautiful Dharma. When a person sees the world as the mortal does not see it. 
[504] Be mindful, scrutinizing the world as a vanity. Withdrawal of selfishness One should overcome death by such a ploy. When a person sees the world in this way, the mortal does not see it. 
[505] The word lok in the abbreviation is suto lok avekkhassu, as follows: Nirayalok, Tiratchanalok, Pittivisaya, human beings, Deva world, Khanthalok, Elemental, Ayana, this world, the other world, the Brahma world. The whole world One of the monks asked the Blessed One, Lord Blessed The Blessed One said that the world, the world as follows. He said, the world, for what reason? The Blessed One replied: "Bhikkhu, I say that the world because it will fall apart. What is different? Broken eye, broken shape, broken spirit eye. Eye contact is broken, feeling is good, suffering is good. All bitterness and suffering are good. that occurs because the eye contact is a factor Even the pain was broken. Cracked ears, cracked sounds, cracked noses, cracked odors, cracked tongues, cracked tastes, cracked bodies, cracked eyes, cracked thoughts, broken spirits, broken spirits, cracked sensations, happiness and pain. All bitterness and suffering are good. that occurs because the mind is a factor Even the pain was broken. Bhikkhus, the dharma with the eye and so on is broken. Therefore we say that the world. The word contemplating the world as a matter of belonging means that one sees the world as Being is perishable for two reasons, namely, with the ability to determine that it is not permissible in power; (1) with the ability to see body as a thing as empty; 1. One considers the world as being as perishable and is able to determine that it is not. How to go in power? No one has power in form, in feeling, in covenant, in body, in spirit. look at the monks Form is selfless. Look at all the monks. If this image would be an ego This image should not lead to anger. and it can be obtained in the form that Let our picture be like this Our picture should not be like this at all. look at the monks But because form is selfless, form is subject to affliction. and inevitably in the form that Let our picture be like this Our image should not be like this. Feelings are soulless. look at the monks If this feeling would be the self This feeling should not lead to affliction. and be satisfied that May our pity be like this Our pity should not be like this. look at the monks but because feeling is selfless So suffering leads to affliction. and inevitably not feeling that May our pity be like this, may our pity be like this. The contract is soulless. look at the monks If this contract would be an ego, then This contract should not be for anger. and received in the promise that May our promise be like this Our promises should never be like this. look at the monks but because the contract is selfless The contract is therefore for the sake of anger. and inevitably in the contract that May our promises be like this, our promises may not be like this. The body is anatta. look at the monks If this sankhara would be an ego This sankhara should not lead to affliction. and will receive in the body that May our body be like this Our body should not be like this at all. look at the monks But because sankhara is non-self, therefore sankhara leads to affliction. and inevitably in the body that May our body be like this Our body should not be like this at all. The soul is soulless. look at the monks If this spirit would be an ego This spirit should not lead to affliction. and will receive in the spirit that May our souls be like this Our spirits should never be like this. look at the monks But because the soul is selfless, then the soul is subject to affliction. and it cannot be in the spirit that this may be our spirit. Our spirits should not be like this at all. look at the monks This body is not yours. Neither of others. look at the monks This old kamma, which is compounded by factors, is intended as the root cause. You should see it as a place of suffering. look at the monks In that body the noble disciple, who has heard it, meditates with the utmost care, saying: for the following reasons When this exists, this exists, because this arises. this happened when this does not exist This does not have because this thing is extinguished
B: because avijja is a factor, there is sankhara. Because body is a factor, there is spirit. Because the spirit is a factor, there is a name and form. Because name and form are factors, there is a collapse. Because salayatana is a factor, there is contact. Because touch is a factor, there is feeling. Because suffering is a factor, there is desire. Because craving is a factor, there is prejudice. Because clinging is a factor, there is a world Because the world is a factor, there is a nation Because birth is a factor, there are aging, death, soka, parideva, suffering, sorrow and upayas. occurrence of All the masses of suffering are like this. because that ignorance is extinguished without regurgitation So the body is extinguished. With the cessation of body, the soul is extinguished; because of the cessation of the soul, the name and form are extinguished. because the name and image are dead because of the death of the body, the contact is extinguished because the sensation of feeling is extinguished because the feeling is extinguished, the desire is extinguished because craving is extinguished, clinging is extinguished Due to the cessation of existence, existence is extinguished; because of existence, birth, old age, death, soka, parideva, suffering, sorrow, and clinging are extinguished. The cessation of all suffering is like this. A person sees the world as an extinction. with the ability to define that it is not in power like this. with being able to consider the sankhara By being empty, how? No one obtains essence in form, in feeling, in perception, in body, in consciousness. Form is without substance, without substance, without substance. In essence, precision is the essence. In essence, happiness is the essence. in essence that he is the essence by precision by sustainability by stability or with normal variance. Feeling without essence, without essence without essence A contract without essence, without essence, without essence, without substance, without essence, without essence, without essence. The soul has no essence, no essence, no essence, essentially absolute is essence. In essence, happiness is the essence. in essence that he is the essence by precision by sustainability by stability or with natural invariability. A reed has no essence, no essence, no essence. In addition, a castor tree has no essence, no essence. In addition, the fig tree has no essence, without essence, without essence, besides, the rak tree has no essence, without essence, besides the golden lang tree has no essence, without essence, without essence, besides, a sponge has no essence, without essence, without essence, a water node has no essence, without essence, a banana tree without essence, without essence. without essence, without essence, just as Phayaem without essence, without essence, without essence, form without essence, without essence, without essence. In essence, precision is the essence. In essence, happiness is the essence. in essence that he is the essence by precision by sustainability by stability or with normal variance Feeling without essence, without essence, without essence A contract without substance, without substance, without substance No essence, no essence, no essence The soul has no essence, no essence, no essence, in the sense that impermanence is essence. In essence, happiness is the essence. in essence that he is quintessentially impartial by sustainability by stability or with normal variance I'm the same. A person sees the world as an extinction. with the ability to consider One sees the body as an emptiness in this way. One sees the world as an emptiness because of these two reasons. On the other hand, One contemplates the world as an extinction by six manifestations: one sees form as impermanence 1 without being able to do what pleases one as a source of discomfort 1 without being in power. 1 On the basis of cause 1 without emptiness 1. One contemplates feelings, perceptions, perceptions, and spirits as being not great ... as emptiness. One contemplates the world as being, as being lost, by these six symptoms. one One contemplates the world as being and by ten things, that is, one contemplates form as emptiness, 1 as emptiness, 1 without self, 1 without substance, 1 as a murderer, 1 by degeneration. 1 as the root of suffering, 1 with taints, 1 as a aggregates with additives 1. One considers feelings, perceptions, perceptions, consciousness, emptiness, ... as compounds. A person sees the world as being of extinction, by these ten things. A person sees the world as being of extinction, by twelve conditions, that is, he considers that Form is not an animal, one is not a person, one is not a man, one is not a manva, one is not a woman, one is not a self, one is not something that is related to oneself, one is not ours, one is not one, and one considers that feeling. Sanya, body, and spirit are not beings … No one else. One sees the world as being and by these 12 things. look at the monks what is not yours You shall leave that thing aside. that which you have abandoned will be for the benefit for long lasting happiness. look at the monks What is not yours? look at the monks The image is not yours. ye shall abandon the image. that image which you have abandoned It will be for the sake of happiness for a long time. look at the monks Feelings are not yours … The contracts are not yours … The sankharas are not yours … Bhikkhus The spirit is not yours. ye shall cast off that spirit. that spirit that you have abandoned will be for the benefit for long lasting happiness. look at the monks Why are you so important to you? What kind of grass, wood, twigs and leaves? that exists in this temple of Jetavana, the people should take away the grass, the sticks, the branches and the leaves. Burn it or do it according to the cause. You should think like this:


all things are gone Burn it or do it for some reason? The monks said: not like that Lord Buddha, why is that? for they are not self, nor are they related to us. Lord Buddha. look at the monks me too Whatever is not yours, leave it alone. that which you have abandoned It is for the benefit of happiness for a long time. look at the monks The image is not yours. ye shall abandon the image. that image which you have abandoned will be for the benefit For long lasting happiness. Look, monks, feeling, covenant, sankhara, the soul is not yours. You shall leave that thing aside. that which you have abandoned will be for the benefit for long lasting happiness. A person sees the world in such a way that it is something that is lost. Venerable Ananda asked the Blessed One: Lord Blessed He said that the world is lost as follows. He said, For how many reasons does the world perish? The Blessed One replied: "O Ananda, because of the loss of oneself, or from what has to do with oneself, therefore, the world is lost." "O Ananda, what is lost from oneself? Or from what has to do with oneself? Eye is lost, form is lost, eye is lost. Eye contact is lost, pleasure is good, suffering is good. All bitterness and suffering are good. that occurs because the eye contact is a factor Even that suffering is lost from oneself or what is related to oneself. The ear is lost, the sound is lost, the nose is lost, the smell is lost, the tongue is lost, the taste is lost, the body is lost, the touch is lost, the mind is lost, the mind is lost, the mind is lost, the mind is lost, the feeling is lost, the pain is gone, the pain is gone, the feeling is bad, and the feeling is lost due to the feeling of mind-contact. Even that suffering is lost from oneself or from what has to do with oneself. See, Ananda, because he is lost from oneself or from that which is related to oneself, therefore, he says that the world is lost. A person sees the world as an extinction in this way. when a person sees the emergence of all dharmas which the continuation of all sankharas As a matter of fact, there is no such danger. Whenever a person contemplates the world with wisdom as grass and wood, then one does not wish for a world or any other existence except for nirvana without conception. and realistically according to the Buddha's words that the Blessed One said: look at the monks A monk will search for images. How many thoughts are there in the image? According to the search for compassion. How many mottos are there? According to the search contract. What is the motto of the contract? According to the search for the body How many thoughts of sankhara exist? In search of souls. How many spirits are there? It's like that. When a monk searches for a picture How many thoughts are there in the image? in search of pity How much is the motto of Vedana? According to the search for contracts, how many mottos of the contract are there? Searching for the body How many thoughts of sankhara exist? in search of souls How many spirits are there? Regardless of holding, by the view that we are good, by the power of lust that we are good, by the power of striving that we are good, whatever monks have. even so There would be none for that monk. A person sees the world as an extinction in this way. Contemplate the world as perishable, that is, look, contemplate, compare, examine, enlighten, make manifest, the world as perishable, therefore it is called contemplate the world as perishable. 
[506] The Blessed One called that Brahman by the name Mogharat in the latter as Mogharat sata sto. The word "everytime" means "everytime", etc. in the latter. The word mindful means being mindful for four reasons, namely, mindfulness and the development of mindfulness. contemplation of the body in the body Etc., that person says that he is mindful, therefore he is called "Dokorn Mogharaja" ... He is mindful at all times. those who do not hear in this world did not see the Lord not wise in the Dharma of the Lord Buddha are not guided in the teachings of the noble one didn't see the beast Not wise in the dharma of the faithful, not guided in the dharma of men. would follow the form by being According to him, he has some pictures. According to the picture in them as he sees himself in form, as he sees feeling, perception, body, and spirit, as he sees himself as having spirit. according to the spirit in them as seen in the spirit already gone supreme ditthi Ditthi is the way of the wilderness Ditthi is an enemy (thorn splinter) Ditthi is wrong.

[729] One who possesses all these dangers, namely cold, heat, hunger, thirst, wind, sun, flies and beasts, wanders alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. 
[730] Cold, in the context of sitaca unhaca khuttam pipasam, thus, there are two reasons: coldness arises through the aggravation of the elements within; 1, coldness arises. By the ability of the external seasons 1. The heat in the word heat arises for two reasons: heat is due to the power of the internal elements; 1) heat is due to the ability of the outer season 1. Hunger He said: Khuda. The thirst for water, he said, Pipasa. Therefore it is called cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. 
[731] The name of the wind is vatatpe dhassirspeca, thus the east wind is the east wind. The west wind, the north wind, the south wind, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows, the wind blows the garuda, the wind leaves the palm, but it blows. The heat but the sun, he said. Yellow-eyed insects, he said, Glimpse. The snake said that the tiger crawled. Therefore, it is called heatstroke, flies, and creeping beasts. 
[732] The word possesses, even all dangers, means possessing, suppressing, eliminating, trampling. should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore. Because of that The Buddha then said, One who possesses all these dangers, namely cold, heat, hunger, thirst, wind, sun, flies, and beasts, wandering alone like a rhinoceros' horn. therefore.
[733] The Pacceka-Buddha has abandoned all groups. have a good birth Dhamma is like a lotus flower, the supreme person lives in the forest according to pleasure. like the Naga which all horde Born ready, having a body like a lotus, supremely supremely in the forest, wandering alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. Therefore, the noble elephant said, "Naga" in the narration "Nakho va Yuthani, Vijjayitva" as follows. Even the Paccekasum Buddha is called a naga. The individual Buddha Why is it called a Naga? The Buddha's name is Naga. for not doing evil because of not reaching because it doesn't come. The Paccekasum Buddha is called a Naga. because of not doing any evil? obscene morality causing misery to be born in a new world to be anxious, anxious, troubled It is the place where the nation of aging and death continues. He said that wickedness, a monk does not do any evil in covetousness, having renounced all the benefits and all the bonds. is a fallen person does not cling to all dharmas. There is a person like that. because he did not do such an evil deed. The Paccekasum Buddha is called a Naga. Why is it not there? The Paccekasam Buddha did not reach a consensus. not up to anger
Not by lust, not by lust, not by power of anger. not with ruthless power not with power not with power not with the power of appeal not with the power of wisdom not by virtue not moving forward with all the dharmas that belong to them. The Paccekasum Buddha is called a Naga. Because it's not like this. The Paccekasum Buddha is called a Naga. Because why not come? Pacceka, the Buddha does not come again, does not return, does not return to all defilements that have been abandoned by the Sotapatti-fold path by the Sakdakami-fold. with the Anagram with the Arhatship. The individual Buddha is called a Naga because he did not come like this. Just as the hordes of elephants, like the Nagas of the herds, are left alone, and the hordes of elephants are left alone, wandering through the forest, wandering, and resting, healing, nurturing, and healing in the forest. so I ignored and let go of the group Traveling alone like a rhinoceros horn, living in the secluded environment, a dense forest, with little voice and no rumbling. Without the wind but the people It should be the secret of human karma. It deserves to be avoided. The Paccekasam Buddha was walking alone, standing alone, sitting alone, lying alone. Entering the house for alms alone, returning alone, sitting alone in a secret place. Praying to you alone He is the one who travels alone, walks, changes his posture, rests, takes care of, nourishes and heals. Therefore, he is called like a whole horde of Nagas. 
[735] The word khanha is born ready. having a body like a lotus, the supreme being, that the supreme elephant is fully born, that is, an elephant with a height of 7 cubits or 8 cubits; The khandha is born ready with the precepts, the samadhi khandha, the wisdom khandha, the wimuttikhanth, the wimuttinyanthassan khandha belonging to the monk Asekha. Just as the noble elephant is an elephant whose body is like a lotus flower, even so is the individual Buddha. There is a Dharma like a lotus, with the lotus, the seven Bojjhana, namely, mindfulness. Thamwiyasamphojong Viriyasamphojong, Pithi Samphojong, Passatthisamphojong Concentration Upekkha Samphojong. Just as a noble elephant is an elephant with might, with might, with speed, with courage, even so is the individual Buddha. He is supreme with morality, concentration, wisdom, vimuti, vimuttinyandassana. hence the name Ready to be born with a lotus flower is the supreme person.
[736] The word dwelt in the forest according to the pleasure that the noble elephant Just as he lives in the forest according to his desires is in the forest according to the passion, that is, in the forest Some in the first jhāna, some in the second jhāna, some in the tadhi jhāna, some in the forest, swaying in the midst of compassion, ceto vimuti. Please jeto some liberation. Mutitajeto liberation some equanimity Live in the forest with a sense of humility Some souls are attained. Some kindness contract Some results, therefore, it is called in the forest according to pleasure. One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. The Paccekasum Buddha then said that the Paccekasum Buddha had abandoned all of the people. have a good birth Dharma like a lotus flower, supremely supreme, dwells in the forest like a serpent, whose horde Ready to be born with a body like a lotus flower, the supreme person, living in the forest One should wander alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. 
[737] Why should a person be right in the liberation of the present? That is why it is the status of a person who delights in the communion of the community. A person has heard the words of the racial Pacceka Buddha. of the sun should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore, 
[738] should be aware of the judgment that Why should a person be right in the liberation that exists in the present day? That's why it is the status of a person who delights in communion with the community. The following is true according to the Buddha's words that the Blessed One said: "O monk, Ananda, enjoys mingling with people. rejoicing in the mingling of groups likes among Entertainment in the group, which often consists of group preferences. to be as desired without difficulty, without difficulty, which is happiness in Nekkhama happiness in seclusion happiness is peace Happiness in enlightenment is not a position to have. Ananda, as for any bhikkhu who escapes from the community alone that a bhikkhu will be happy, that is, You can get what you want, without difficulty, without difficulty, which is happiness in the Nekkhama. happiness in seclusion happiness is peace happiness in enlightenment This is a position to have. See Ananda. Bhikkhus like to be mingled with groups. welcomed in the mingling with the group accompanies group-loving, group-loving, merry-go-round, merry-go-round consisted of frequent preferences will attain the ceto liberation that exists in the day or the world of the unenlightened world which did not exist in modern times That is not a position to have. See, Ananda, as for any bhikkhu who escapes from the community alone. that a bhikkhu will be happy, that is, will attain the ceto liberation that exists in the day or the world of the unenlightened world which did not exist in modern times This is a position to have. Therefore, why should a person be right in the liberation that exists in the present day? That is why it is the status of a person who delights in the communion of the community. 
[739] Phra Suriya said that the sun in the prophecy was e.c.cchaponthussa vajo nisamma as follows. The sun is doomed by contemporaries. Even the Paccekasum Buddha was a god by his contemporaries. Even the Buddha is a relative be a race by the descent of the sun because of that Therefore, the Paccekasama Buddha is called a race. of the sun. had heard the words of the indigenous Individual Buddha of the sun means to have heard, heard, studied, and remembered
predetermined, which the words are the official words, sermons, sermons, of the sun, therefore the name is heard, of the sun One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. The Buddha then said, Why should a person be right in the liberation that exists in the present day? That is why it is the status of a person who delights in the communion of the community. the person has listened which the words of the Buddha, who is a race of the sun should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore 
[740] I have passed away from the thorny view. It has reached the definition There is already a specific path is a spiritual person born which others do not need to recommend So one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. 
[741] Twenty objects of view say that the view is a thorn in the world says: Ditthivisukani upatiwatto. did not see the lord not wise in the Dharma of the noble monks not recommended in the teachings of the noble monks didn't see the beast Not wise in the dharma of the faithful, not guided in the dharma of the faithful. He sees form as he is, sees himself as having form, or sees form in himself. see him in the picture Seeing suffering by being … seeing promise by being … seeing body as being … seeing spirit as being. saw that he had a soul see the spirit in them See yourself in the spirit. Ditthi saw this, ditthi is gone, ditthi is raging, ditthi is thorny. swing Ditthi is a benefit Confidence, clinging, humiliation, wicked way, wrong way, guilt, ideology of guilt warp perversion, misconception Things that are not true Ditthi 62. These are thorny views. The word "passed" means "passed away, passed away, passed away, and the view is thorns, therefore the view is the thorns, therefore the view is the thorns." All. 
[742] The Four Paths and the Noble Path consist of eight elements, namely Sammāditthi … Right concentration. must have been made known by the Four Noble Paths, therefore it is called that the Path has been reached. has a specific path, meaning that there is a specific path There is already a specific path There is a path that is attained There is a right path, therefore the name is reached. 
[743] The word enlightened has arisen. which others do not need to suggest, means that the Pacceka-Buddha has intellect. to arise, to arise, to arise, to arise, to appear, that is, to arise arises, arises, arises only; it appears that all conditioned things are impermanent. All sankharas are suffering. All dharmas are selfless. Something happens naturally. the whole thing All of them are naturally fading away, therefore they are called enlightened ones. The word that others do not need to advise means that the Pacceka Buddha which others do not have to recommend, that is, do not believe others No other person is a factor not going by the intellect due to others; he is not passionate, conscious, will know and see as it really is All things are impermanent. Etc. Something is happening naturally. All things are naturally extinguished, therefore they are called enlightened ones. which others do not need to recommend should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn; therefore, Then the Paccekasama Buddha said that we have passed away from all the thorny views. It has reached the definition There is already a specific path is a spiritual person born which others do not need to recommend One should wander alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. 
[744] The individual Buddha is not greedy, does not lie, does not thirst, does not humiliate. There is a sin as astringent taste and delusion that has been eliminated. There is no hope in the whole world. One should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn, therefore. that greedy The Paccekasambuddha had abandoned it, cut it off, and made it impossible for him to have a place like a palm tree. to the absence later Not to happen any more normally. because of that Therefore, the individual Buddha is not greedy. There are three objects of lies in the word non-lie: Objects of lies are part of the substance of consumption 1. Objects of lies are part of action 1. Objects of lies are part of Dharma speaking. 1. Why is the object of lies part of the substance abuse? The householders in this world would invite monks with robes, alms, senas, and medicinal materials. The monk had a lewd desire. which desire has taken over There is a need for robes, alms, senas, and kilan. Pharmacological factors very lustful Discontinue receiving robes, binthabat, Senasana, and Kilan factors in pharmaceuticals. She said this What would a monk want with a robe of great value? Priests should travel to pick up old clothes. from some cemetery from a pile of pulp, some from the market, and then make some sacrifices for consumption That's right. What will the monks wish with alms to be of great value? monks should feed Living with food obtained with the leaves by wandering That's right. What will the monks wish with sanasana is very valuable? The monk should be at the foot of the tree or in the open place. That was appropriate. What would a monk wish with a very valuable medicinal factor? Priests should make potions with rotten mollusks, some with anchor pieces. That's right. She is very lustful. consumed the sorrowful robe, I alms Use the sorrowful Senasana Addicted to the sad pharmacological factor

Dull. The householders know that monk like this: This monk had little desire. a loner who likes solitude irrelevant preach perseverance a person who has dispelled words He was very invited with alms robes, senas and kilanna factors of medicine. The monk said thus: A believing clan will experience a lot of merit because of three factors at the same time, namely the believing son will experience a lot of merit Because there is faith with one page, because there is a Thai Dharma with one page, because there are Thakhina people with one page. 1. All of you have this faith. Thai Dharma is present. and the sixth ego exists. If I will not accept because I did not accept You will lose merit. The ego has no will on this matter, but I will accept it for your favor. A bhikkhu is very greedy, receives many robes, receives many alms. Received a lot of sanas, received a lot of kilan, a lot of medicinal factors. smile stubbornness, lies, deceitful behavior Being a liar, so you see, that the object of lies is part of the addiction. Why is the object of lies part of the gesture? Some monks in this religion have obscene desires that dominate. Wanting to be praised by him, thinking that the community will praise me in this manner, he walks, sits, sits, lies, walks, walks, sits, sits, sits, walks like a monk. standing like a meditating monk sitting like a meditating monk, lying like a meditating monk It is like a meditation in the presence of human beings. Initiation, determination, posture stubbornness, lies, deceitful behavior Being such a liar, you say that the object of lies is part of action. Why is the object of lying a part of Dharma talk? Some monks in this religion lustful of desire wishing to be praised by him, wishing that the community would glorify us by saying this. So he spoke based on the noble dharma, saying that a monk using a robe sees it like this, is very powerful, a monk using a monk's bowl sees it like this. Using a metal vessel, saw this Use a cloth to filter the water like this. Use the ball. See like this. Use these shoes Use a lumbar support like this. Use the yoke line to see like this. Very powerful. and said that the ascetic who had such a preceptor saw this very powerful A monk who has a teacher sees it like this. Some of the co-preceptors saw it like this There are people who are friendly like this. There are friends who have seen each other like this. There are friends who have come together to see this. A friend saw this Very powerful. and said that the monk in the temple saw it like this and was very powerful; he who lived in a shed with a single strip of roof saw it like this. Those in the bald house saw like this; those in the cave saw like this. The inhabitants saw this. The people in the canopy saw it like this. The inhabitants of the fort saw this. The inhabitants of the factory saw this. The residents of the accommodation saw this. The inhabitants of the factory saw this. The man in the mandap sees like this, the man at the foot of the tree sees like this. very powerful, besides, a monk who bows his head more than one who bows his head more than one who raises his head a liar than a liar the speaker is much more than the talker whom others praise with one's mouth uttering such profound and profound words that the wise man conceals This recluse was able to see a peaceful meditation hall like this. smile stubbornness, lies, deceitful behavior Being a liar sees this He said that the object of lies was part of the Dharma talk. The objects of these three lies are abandoned, cut off, calmed, suppressed, preventing their emergence. burned with fire is the soul because of that The individual Buddha does not lie. Craving, lust, saraga, etc. Abhijha lobha akusalamul He said that in the word thirst, there is no thirst. lust that causes thirst The Buddha has left root cut off Do not have a location like Tan Yod Duan to the absence later not to continue to happen normally because of that Therefore, the individual Buddha is not thirsty. hence the name There is no greed, no lie, no thirst. profanity jealousy It's called blasphemy, in the sense that there is no defamation There are sins like astringent tastes and delusions that have been eliminated as follows. Named as astringent sins, namely lust, hatred, delusion, anger, anger, anger, arrogance, etc., all aggression is as astringent (each of them). ignorance in all suffering, ignorance in all ignorance in every nirvana ignorance in every nirodkamini practice ignorance in the beginning ignorance in the latter part ignorance both in the beginning and in the end; This is the fact that this sankharadhi Dharma is a factor of one another, ignorance, ignorance, and specific inadequacy. ignorance ignorance ready impermanence inadequacy indecision disagreement disregard Impermanence, imperfection, foolishness, complete ignorance, delusion, delusion, ignorance is void. Avijja is yoga Avijja is a monument Avijja is the foundation ignorance as a net Avijja is a snare. Moha. Akusala is called Moha. Abuse. Sin is like astringent taste and delusion. The Pacceka-sama Buddha was vomited, eliminated, abandoned, cut off, calmed, suppressed, preventing its occurrence. burned with fire is the soul because of that The individual Buddha therefore there is no disrespect There is a sin as astringent taste and delusion that has been eliminated. 
[747] Craving, lust, saraga, etc. Abhijha lobha, kusala-mun He said that hope in the world is the one who has no hope in all worlds. in all human beings in all the worlds in all the worlds, in the elements
All the worlds, in all the worlds. The word 'hopeless' in all worlds means 'one without hope, one who has no desires. one who has no appetite in all the world hence the name one who has no hope in all the world So travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. because of that The individual Buddha He said that the Buddha was not greedy, did not lie, did not thirst, was not blasphemous. There is a sin as astringent taste and delusion that has been eliminated. There is no hope in the whole world. travel alone So like the horn of a rhinoceros.
[748] Avoid evil companions. unprofitable who is always upright One should not consume a person who is selfish and careless, should wander like a rhinoceros horn. Therefore 
[749] evil comrades in the word "Papam sayam parivajjayet" as the sage said: A friend who is made up of ten cultivators says that an alms given has no effect. The sacrificial sacrifice has no effect. There are no consequences of good and bad deeds, there is no world, there is no next world, no mother, no father, no living beings. Brahmins who practice good practice enlightened this world and the hereafter through self-knowledge and proclaimed none in the world as follows. hence the name Ignore the evil comrades. 
[750] A comrade who does not see the benefit in the narrative saying, Anattadasa visme niut, as the sage said: A friend who has ten objects that he has given has no effect. The sacrificial sacrifice has no effect, etc. enlightened this world and the hereafter through self-knowledge, and then proclaimed that there is none in the world as follows. One who is inconsistent in dharma, means one who is perpetual in kamma, in impermanent speech. In the not always in the alliance that is not always In the impermanent indignity, in the perpetually ignorant game In a lie that is not always in the inconsistent pisana speech in the inconsistent speech In a touch that is not always In the Abhijha that is not always In the vengeful that is not always in the ill-wisher that is not always In the impermanent body, one who dwells, is attached, secretly, approaches, is enthralled, enthralls in the five impermanent qualities, therefore he is called the one who does not see the benefit. One who is established in impermanence. 
[751] The word one who seeks, in the context, says: saยna seve pasutam, pamattam. Thus, whoever seeks, seeks, seeks for sensual pleasures, conducts in sensual pleasures. lewd striving to be dominant Even that person is called a lustful person. Whoever seeks form, obtains form, consumes form with the ability to lust one who behaves in forms, greedy in forms, heavy in forms, leans in forms, transfers in forms, sags in forms, inclines to forms. aim big Even that person is called a lustful person. Whoever seeks a voice ... Whoever seeks a scent behave in the dungeon avid heavy in the palm Lean into the palm transfer to the dart soft in the dart bowed his heart to the top Even that person is called a lustful person. Heedlessness should be said in the word pamattam as follows: releasing the mind, increasing the mind, releasing the mind. In a corrupt body In the word corruption is good. In corruption is good. In the benjakam you are good. or acts without generosity Non-repetitive action, cessation of action, slack behavior, volition, ambition, errands, non-addiction, non-prosperity, not making much. inattention, inattention In the practice of charity, negligence, reckless behavior, heedlessness, he saw it like this, he said negligence. should not join should not be consumed should not behave, should not be willing to behave, should not behave and people who seek and careless. Therefore, the name should not be consumed by those who seek and those who are negligent by themselves should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore. Because of that Then the Paccekasama Buddha said to abstain from evil companions. unprofitable who is always upright One should not consume people who are diligent and careless by themselves. travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore, 
[752] should be friends with those who are virtuous, virtuous, virtuous, accommodating, and know all benefits. get rid of doubt travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore, 
[753] the word pahusut in the Uthea is bhahusutham dhammadharam bhajetha, thus, he is the one who hears a lot. a righteous person who has heard to assimilate the dharmas that have been heard, that is, these dharmas that are beautiful in the beginning beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the end, with meaning and consonant proclaiming absolute purity Dharma saw that It is fair that the friend hears a lot. He remembers fluently in his mouth and in his heart, stabbed all the time with the view. The word dhammadharam means that the righteous is Sutta, Kayya, grammar, spell, ejaculate, itivuttaka, jataka, upbhuttadhamma, vetala. One should associate with one who is virtuous, ought to associate, ought to consume, ought to go in, ought to be consumed, ought to be accommodating, ought to be accommodating to a friend who is a scholar and a righteous person. A friend who is supreme with morality, concentration, wisdom, vimuti, vimuttinyanadassana, in the saying, mittam, ularam, patiphanavana, as follows. There are three types: one who is enlightened by virtue of enlightenment; one who is enlightened by enlightenment; one who is enlightened by attaining 1. What is a person who is enlightened by virtue? Some people in this world study the Buddha's words, namely Sutta, Kayya, grammar, spells, exclaim, itivuttaka, jataka, upbhuta dharma, vedalla. Because it relies on learning. This person's name is
that those who are prudent because they rely on rules. Why is a person who is intelligent because of impermanence? Some people in this world He is an inquisitor, in arahatship, in the Noble Eightfold Path, in the nature of ignorance, in cause, status and status. The Word of the Buddha becomes clear to that person. Because it relies on inquiry. This person's name is Who is enlightened by enlightenment. Why is one who is enlightened by attaining? Some people in this world One who attains the four foundations of satipatthana, 4 power, 4 organics, 5 strength, 5 enlightenment, 7 noble path, the 8 noble path, 4 common results, 4 admiration, 4 agnostics 6. One knows the meaning, the Dharma, the Niruti. The meaning becomes clear, when the Dharma is known, the Dharma becomes clear. When I know Niruti Niruti was clear. Wisdom in these three things is enlightenment. The Paccekasambuddha enters, enters, enters, enters, enters, enters, completes, complete with this insight. because of that Therefore, the Pacceka-Buddha is called enlightened. who has no law There is no enlightenment, there is no dharma, what doctrine will become clear to that person? having insight.
[755] the word knowing all benefits Let go of doubt, that is to know thoroughly, to know, to compare, to consider clearly. make it appear self-interest benefit others Both sides benefit current benefits Benefits in the universe should be eliminated, eradicated, alleviated, brought to an end, leading to nothing. which doubts, therefore it is known that all benefits have been known get rid of doubt One should travel alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. Therefore, the Pacceka-Buddha said that one should be friends with a monk who is virtuous, virtuous, enlightened, and knows all benefits. get rid of doubt One should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. 
[756] The Pacceka Buddha does not delight in play, pleasure and pleasure in the world, does not mourn, except from the position of decorations be a true speaker One should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. 
[757] The name of playing in the Udesh is khitha rati kamasukca loka, as follows: two types of play: one physical play, one verbal play. etc. This is called physical play. etc. This is called verbal play. The word joy is a reference to the being who is not anxious. The word sensual pleasure means that it is true according to the Buddha's words that the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, what are the five qualities of sensual pleasures? is a form that is known by the eye. Desirable, pleasing, lovable, seductive, voluptuous, a sound to be enlightened by the ear. A scent to be enlightened by the nose Taste to be known by the tongue To be enlightened by the body Desirable, desirable, pleasing, lovely, seductive, voluptuous. Monks, these are the five qualities of sensual pleasures, monks. Where happiness arises, through these five qualities of sensual pleasures, we say that sensual pleasures are therefore called sensual pleasures. The word in the world is in the human world, therefore it is called ... play, pleasure, and sensual pleasure in the world. 
[758] The word does not please, does not mourn, does not satisfy the play, the pleasure and the pleasures of the world. one who does not mourn, that is, abandoning, alleviating, bringing to an end, leading to nothing, therefore, it is called not pleasing, not mourning.

The Buddha then said, The Pacceka-Buddha does not delight in play, pleasure and pleasure in the world, does not mourn, except from the position of decorations be a true speaker One should wander alone like the horn of a rhinoceros. 
[760] The Pacceka-Buddha leaves his son, father, mother, wealth, family, and all sensual pleasures. travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore, 
[761] sons in the word puttam in the word puttaca taram pitrāca matara, as follows: there are four: one born from oneself, one born in one region, one born from one He gave one son who was in the office. 1. His wife said, Tara. The man who gave birth to a child is called the father. A woman who gives birth to a child is called a mother. Therefore they are called sons, Tara, fathers and mothers. As follows. Things to eat first. The things that were eaten later, he said: Grains. Wheat, glutinous rice, glutinous rice, millet, grass and kale are the names of the things that are eaten first. Curry is the name of the food that is eaten later. There are 4 types of comrades in the word Phanthavani: P.

A wise person knows that This sensuality is like an abscess, meaning a wise person graduate with knowledge enlightened, enlightened, enlightened having the wisdom to destroy defilements, knowing, that is, comparing, contemplating, making it clear, making it appear that This sensual pleasure is as an abscess, as a hook, as a prey, as an attachment and an anxiety. This eroticism is like an abscess. One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. The Buddha then said, This eroticism is related. less happy There is little joy, much suffering. A wise person knows that This sensual pleasure is like an abscess, therefore one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn. Destroyed all benefits like fish destroying the net. and like a raging fire that does not return One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn, therefore. Wichikitchasanyojan Silaphot Pramassanyojan Bhavaraksayojana benefit benevolence Avijchasa benefit. The word "destroyed" means "destroying, destroying", "destroying", "relieving", "ending", leading to the absence of the ten fetters, hence the name "destroying" all fetters. 
[770] A net made of thread, he said: "Net" in the context of shalava bhatva salilmbujari thus: The water said: Salila. The fish said: Ambujari, animals wandering in the water. Destroyed fish, breaking through the net. There are two kinds of nets, namely, the net is lust, the net is ditthi, and 1. Etc., this is called the net is lust. etc., this is called The network is the view. The Pacceka-sama Buddha is neglecting the net of lust. Giving up the net is like that. because he is the one who breaks the net, is lust surrender net is The view is broken. The Pacceka Buddha is not involved, not attached, not involved in form, sound, smell, taste, touch, in the form seen and heard. Emotion to know Dharma to be enlightened, released, shaken off, liberated, irrelevant. having a mind that keeps no boundaries; therefore it is called like a fish that breaks the net. 
[771] The word, like a fire that spreads and does not return, means that the Pacceka-Buddha does not come.

not coming back, not coming back, to the defilements that have been abandoned by the Sotapattimaga, not coming back, not coming back, not coming back To the defilements that have been abandoned by the Sakdakami Path, not to come again, not to come back, not to return to the defilements that have been abandoned by the Anagami Path, not to come again, not to come back, not to return to the defilements that have been abandoned by the Arhat Path, like the burning of grass and wood. did not return, therefore it is called like a fire that spreads and does not return. One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. Therefore, the Pacceka Buddha said: Buddha Destroyed all benefits like fish destroying the net. and like a raging fire that does not return One should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. one who has a downward eye not sloppy because of the feet organic protection have a healed heart passion is not soaked the fire of passion does not burn should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore, 
[773] one should know and judge in the context that okkhittacakkhun ca patalolo as follows: How is a bhikkhu who does not restrain his eyes? Some monks in this Dharma and Discipline being illusory because of the eye Consists of being illusory because of the eye. with the intention that We'll look at pictures we've never seen. I will pass through the pictures I've seen before. So left this monastery to that monastery. From this garden to that garden From this house to that house, from this estate to that estate from this city to that city From this state to that state, from this country to that country. a long-time traveler non stop travel to see the picture. A bhikkhu is one who does not keep his eyes open like this. one more thing The bhikkhus entered the neighborhood, walking down the street, refusing to walk to see the army of elephants, look at the cavalry, look at the army of chariots, look at the army on foot, look at the pediatrics, look at the kumaris, look at the women, look at the men, look at the market stalls, look at the gates of the houses, look above, look below, look. The direction of the great and the small walks. A bhikkhu is one who does not restrain his eyes in such a way. one more thing A bhikkhu sees a form with his eye, holds visions, holds consonants. would not practice in order to reunite that, when not consolidated should cause unwholesome qualities that are lewd, namely covetousness and sorrow, to take over Not treating Chakhunsee Not reaching the composure in Chakhunsee. A bhikkhu is one who does not comprehend the eye in such a way. like some brahmins I have given him food in faith. who is eager to see the play which is an enemy to charity, sees it as such: dancing, singing, entertaining, dancing, etc., storytelling, clapping songs, and conjuring up spirits. Playing drums, picture scenes, beautiful towns Outcast's play climbing Playing in front of the funeral, hitting elephants, hitting horses, hitting buffaloes, crashing cattle, colliding goats, fighting cocks, fighting quails, and dancing in Krabi Krabong. Boxing, wrestling, battles, inspections, organizing troops, the army. This one. A monk enters the neighborhood walking down the street as a meditator Don't watch the Elephant Army, don't watch the Horse Army. don't look at army cars Do not look at the army on foot don't look at pediatrics don't look at the kumaris don't look at women don't look at men don't look at the market Don't look at the door, don't look above, don't look below. Do not look at the big and small directions, walk. Even this way, a monk is the cultivator of the eye. How does a monk practice the eye? monks in this discipline Not a fool because the eye does not have a foolishness because of the eye. With no intention that we will look at pictures that have never been seen I will pass through the pictures I've seen before. Do not leave this monastery to that monastery. not from this garden to that garden not from this house to that house not from this settlement to that settlement not from this city to that city not from this state to that state not from this country to that country Not wanting to travel for a long time, going to stop to see pictures. A bhikkhu is the one who cultivates the eye like this. A bhikkhu sees a form with his eye, does not hold visions, does not hold consonants. would practice in order to commune with Khuntree that, when not consolidated should cause unwholesome qualities that are lewd, namely covetousness and sorrow, to take over would preserve Chakhunsee To the composure in Chakhunsee. A bhikkhu is a master of the eye in this way. like some brahmins I have given him food in faith. One who does not seek to see a play that is an enemy to a wholesome thing, that is, a dance, a driving, a fanfare, etc., to look at an army, a monk refrains from looking at a play that is an enemy to a virtuous one. A bhikkhu is a master of the eye in this way. Be aware of the judgment in the country that Not foolishly because of the feet, as follows: How is a bhikkhu become foolish by his feet? Some monks in this Dharma and Discipline a slouch because of the feet Consists of being a slouch because of the feet. Leaving from this monastery to that monastery … from this country to that country. is a long-time traveler Travel non-stop. A bhikkhu is vain because of his feet. one more thing A bhikkhu is a bhikkhu who is vain because his inner feet are distracted, his mind is restless, not because of benefit. not because of the reason it was used from this area to that area From this temple to that temple From this shed to that shed From this castle to that castle From this bald house to that bald house From this cave to that cave From this place to that place From this hut to that hut From this canopy to that canopy, from this citadel to the fort From this factory to that factory From this property to that property, from this storehouse to that storehouse. From this mill to that mill From this mandapa to that mandapa From the base of this tree to the base of that tree in the place where the monks sit or are walking There is only one image, it is included as the second image. There are two images, it is the third image. or there are three forms, the fourth one speaks very frivolously, that is, talks about kings, thieves, etc., about progress and decline. not swayed by his feet, that is, the Pacceka-Buddha is the one who refrains, refrains, shakes off, is liberated, irrelevant. with being a liar because
Dare to have a mind that makes no boundaries exist. love the seclusion welcomed in seclusion cultivating inner peace contains introspection Poonsunyakarn Peng Chan, delighted in the contemplation, persevering in unity heavy on one's own benefit, therefore, it is called a person who is restrained in the eye and is not foolish by the feet.
[774] Seeing a form with the eye, does not hold visions, does not hold consonants. would practice in order to commune with Khuntree that, when not consolidated should cause unwholesome virtues that are obscene that is, being overwhelmed by greed and sorrow, he is able to maintain the Chakhuntree, he is restrained in the Chakhuntree. listen by ear sniffing with nose to taste with the tongue, touch with the body enlightened by the mind, does not hold visions, does not hold consonants would practice in order to consolidate the inorganic that, when not consolidated should cause unwholesome qualities that are lewd, namely covetousness and sorrow, to take over will preserve the inorganic It is comprehension in the inorganic, therefore it is called the protector of the organic matter. having a mind guarded means having a protected mind means having a mind healed hence the name There is a protected organic Have a healed heart. 
[775] The word defilement is not soaked in the word Anavassuto aparidaymano, thus it is true according to the Sovereign Phra Maha Moggallana said: Behold, old men We will show you the Unsettled Scriptures and the Unsettled Scriptures. You listen to that sermon. Pay attention. We will say. So you who are of the following age Venerable Maha Moggallana said: Behold, old men So how is a bhikkhu soaked in defilements?

Well, how is a bhikkhu who is unsatisfied with defilements? Behold, old men monks in this discipline I saw the picture with my eyes. I'm not happy in a cute picture. Not sympathetic in unattractive forms having a mind filled with infinite dharmas And that bhikkhu knows as it really is ceto liberation, wisdom, which is the cessation of the unwholesome unwholesome qualities that have arisen to you, having heard the sound with the ear, etc. does not rejoice in the lovely Dharma having a mind filled with infinite dharmas And that bhikkhu knows clearly according to the reality of ceto liberation, wisdom, which is the cessation of the unwholesome unwholesome qualities that have arisen to you. Behold, old men This bhikkhu said that he had not been soaked in defilements. in forms to be enlightened by the eye, in sounds to be enlightened by the ear, etc., in the mind to be enlightened.

If the devil comes to that monk by ear Mara doesn't have access to factors, etc., if Mara comes to that monk mentally. The devil was not a channel, not a factor. Behold, old men like a kutakan sala or the ridge of a pavilion with thick soil and wet plaster Even if a man took a torched grass and ignited the house in the east The lights weren't, the channels weren't a factor. Even if a man would take a torch of grass and light the house in the west,

Behold, old men This is how a bhikkhu is not soaked in defilements hence the name The person who has passion is not soaked anymore. The word The fire of defilement does not burn, meaning that one who consumes fire is lust, fire is hatred, fire is delusion, it does not burn, therefore it is called The one who has no desire is not soaked. The passion fire doesn't burn So travel alone like a rhinoceros horn. Therefore, the Buddha said, Buddha one who has a downward eye not sloppy because of the feet organic protection have a healed heart passion is not soaked the fire of passion does not burn should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn therefore. and brought down the mark of the layman holding the astringent-dyed cloth for ordaining Like a parichhattaka tree with thick leaves, one should wander alone like a rhinoceros horn, therefore.

Continue to search for other flavors He is delighted, enthralled, delighted, fascinated, sluggish, involved, involved in all tastes. The Paccekasaka Buddha has left. root cut off Why does it have a location like Tan Yod Duan? to the absence later not to continue to happen normally Because of that, the Buddha scrutinize by ingenuity, then I feed not me to play not me for infatuation not me to decorate not me to decorate I for this body to exist, so that this body may be, to heal persecution. to pay tribute to the virtuous with respect that We will get rid of the old suffering will not let new misfortunes arise It will be easy, there will be no blame, there will be peace. With me the food is only determined. Only those who apply the wounds for the benefit will grow for a certain time, or the carts drop the axle For the benefit of carrying out the burden only, or the cannibals for the sake of leaving only the path of the wilderness scrutinize, then I diet No, I'm not for play, I'm not for the intoxication … I will be happy with my diet only determined. The Paccekasambuddha is the one who abstains, abstains, withdraws, shakes off, liberates, is irrelevant. with passion in taste There is a mind that makes no boundaries. hence the name Not addicted to all the flavors. The word no lust that causes liquefaction
Lai means lust, lust, saraga, etc. Abhijha, lobha, and kusala-mullah, he said, that it causes laziness, or that it causes it to flow. lust which causes the greed to flow The Paccekasum Buddha has already abandoned. The roots are cut off and there is no place for the palm shoots. to the absence later Not to happen any more as usual. That is why the Pacceka-Buddha is called having no desire, which causes illusory. Therefore, it is called not being attracted to tastes, having no cravings that cause illusory. feed only oneself not feeding others, I call those who do not feed others, appearing and firmly established in the Dharma have finished spit out the punishment that He is a brahmin, therefore he is called one who does not care for others. who travels in the order of the alleys, saying that in the morning, the Pacceka-sama Buddha is at peace holding alms and robes to enter a house or settlement for alms have a healing body, speech, and mind sane already have organic Consolidating the eye with gestures going from one family to another, traveling for alms, hence the name not feeding others.

Atma you have, robes, alms, senasanas, and medicinal necessities by relying on you, and others relying on you. for your sake Therefore it is important to give or to do for Atma. The name and genealogy of Atma's former father Yomma Yom has deteriorated. I would say that We are the group of worshipers over there. We are the clans of the Upasika. Because of you. A bhikkhu is one who sets himself low, sets others high, having such a entangled mind. How does a bhikkhu set himself high and set others low? said the monk I have patronage much to you all. By relying on your ego, you have reached the Buddha as your refuge. to the Dharma as a refuge to the monks as a refuge Abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and drinking intoxicants are liquor and intoxication, which is the place of negligence. Ego comes to support Let the parlance tell the Ubosot Pray for innovation to all of you. when so You have given up your ego and worshiped and worshiped others. Bhikkhus set themselves high, set others low. There is such an intertwined mind. The word having a mind that is not affiliated with the family means that the Paccekasam Buddha having a mind free from worries in the family, abbot, robes, alms, senasana, and kilan factors hence the name having a mind that is not entangled in the family should travel alone like a rhinoceros horn Therefore.
