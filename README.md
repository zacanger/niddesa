## About

There has never been a complete English language translation of [the
Niddesa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niddesa). After asking on Stack Exchange,
I got [an answer](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522) that pointed
me to a Sinhala translation, which I figured I could use to automate an English
translation. I then also found a complete Chinese translation and did the same
thing with that.

It will take work and time to clean up the generated translations
and make them readable. In the future I may try to learn Pali and do a fresh
translation from the source (see those files in this repo, or the Pali Text
Society's Romanizations on the Internet Archive).

The auto-generated translations were done using Google and Amazon's translation
services. The Yandex and IBM Watson translations were terrible, not worth trying
to use.

There are more READMEs in this repo that may be interesting to you if you poke
around a bit. If you find a problem or want to help, please feel free to [submit
an
issue](https://github.com/zacanger/niddesa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
The bulk of the open work now is in taking the two generated translations and
trying to get one decent translation out of them.
