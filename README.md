I recommend downloading the PDF or EPUB files, as the HTML is quite large and
may bog down your browser.

## About

See ./book/00-introduction.md in the repo.

### The Text

The auto-generated translations were done using Google and Amazon's translation
services. The Yandex and IBM Watson translations were terrible, not worth trying
to use.

The ./book directory in the repo contains the contents. If you find a problem or want to help, please feel
free to [submit an
issue](https://github.com/zacanger/niddesa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
The ./pali directory is for reference.

### The Code

The initial translation code is in [this
repo](https://github.com/zacanger/translate-batches). To build the book, run
`make`. You will need various dependencies: make, pandoc, a LaTeX setup
including xetex (mactex or texlive-xetex, depending on your platform), as well
as the Cardo font.

To release a new edition, update the introduction and create a tag along with a
versioning commit. Example:

```
git commit --allow-empty -am v2 && \
  git tag -m v2 -a v2 && \
  git push origin master --follow-tags
```

## TODO

Possible v2 work:
* Go back and compare section by section with the Pali and with the ParamatthajotikƒÅ
* Get someone else to proofread/edit to pick up anything I missed
* Fill in `omitted, see previous sections` bits
