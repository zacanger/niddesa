I recommend downloading the PDF or EPUB files, as the HTML is quite large and
may bog down your browser.

## About

See ./book/00-introduction.md in the repo.

### The Text

The auto-generated translations were done using Google and Amazon's translation
services. The Yandex and IBM Watson translations were terrible, not worth trying
to use.

The ./book directory in the repo contains the contents. If you find a problem or want to help, please feel
free to [submit an
issue](https://github.com/zacanger/niddesa/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).
The ./pali directory is for reference.

### The Code

The initial translation code is in [this
repo](https://github.com/zacanger/translate-batches). To build the book, run
`make`. You will need various dependencies: make, pandoc, a LaTeX setup
including xetex (mactex or texlive-xetex, depending on your platform), as well
as the Cardo font.

To make a new release, run `make release-major` or `make release-minor`, then
`git push --follow-tags`. Patch changes should not result in new releases.

## TODO

Possible v2 work:
* Include a glossary
* Go back and compare section by section with the Pali and with the ParamatthajotikƒÅ
* Get someone else to proofread/edit to pick up anything I missed
* Fill in `omitted, see previous sections` bits (this will make the whole thing
  much much longer, but might make things easier for folks who just want to look
  up specific suttas instead of reading the whole book)
