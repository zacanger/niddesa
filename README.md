## TODO:

* [x] Get the A. P. de Zoysa sinhalese translation from Sutta Central html
* [x] Convert that to Markdown for easier processing
* [ ] Clean up the markdown (remove bad unicode characters and extraneous stuff)
* [ ] Try automating a translation using Google Translate and possibly others
* [ ] Clean up the auto translation(s)

Possibly in the future, try the same process but starting with the Pali. There
don't seem to be any good Pali->English APIs out there right now, but there are
some _okay_ ones. I could also just learn Pali.
