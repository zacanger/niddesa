<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The Niddesa is an ancient part of the Pāli Canon, the traditional texts of Theravāda Buddhism, from the Khuddaka Nikāya (the ‘small’ or ‘miscellaneous’ collection) in the Sutta Piṭaka (the basket of discourses). It is a commentary on parts of the Sutta Nipāta (section of suttas), and is attributed to Venerable Sāriputta (Pāli; Sanskrit Śāriputra), though was likely finalized a few hundred years after his death. There are two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mahā Niddesa (Nd 1), a commentary on the Atṭḥaka Vagga (Sn 4)</li>
<li>The Cūlạ Niddesa (Nd 2), a commentary on the Pārāyana Vagga (Sn 5) and the Khaggavisānạ Sutta (Rhinoceros Sutta, Sn 1.3)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this text is a commentary on sections of the Sutta Nipāta, there’s no need to be familiar with that work first, as the verses commented on are translated here. At the same time, if you are just a casual reader interested in the early suttas, I would recommend reading one of the translations of the Sutta Nipāta instead; this is a somewhat technical commentary intended for scholars and deeper understanding of the suttas, and may be too detailed and dry for the casual reader.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-translation">About This Translation</h2>
<p>There has never been a complete English language translation before. After asking around online, I got <a href="https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/a/43712/19522">an answer</a> that pointed me to a Sinhala translation; I also later found a Chinese translation. Not knowing Sinhala or Chinese, I automated translations using a bit of code, and took these translations and wrangled them into this edition. As the work progressed I referenced Pāli Romanizations more and more, with the help of some dictionaries, so this translation is a combination of the translation from the Chinese and Pāli, with some occasional help from the translation from the Sinhala. There will likely be many errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies in this early version, but it will improve with time.</p>
<p>This translation prefers Pāli over Sanskrit terms (dhamma vs. dharma, kamma vs. karma, etc.). If you’re used to the Sanskrit terms — to paraphrase Engels, changing the words we use a bit won’t change the things themselves. The Chinese variously translates Bhagavā as <em>Lord</em>, <em>World-Honored One</em>, and <em>Blessed One</em>, and other English translations will also sometimes just write <em>Bhagavāt</em>; I’ve chosen to use <em>Blessed One</em> because I like the feel of it. I have also chosen not to capitalize pronouns when referring to the Buddha, as I feel that creates too much of a god-like air; Christians capitalize pronouns when referring to their god, but the Buddha was not a god, he was a human teacher. Capitalization of the word <em>dhamma</em> is more or less at my discretion — this is always difficult since <em>dhamma</em> could refer to a method, the Method, a fact, anything that exists, the Truth, a law, the Law, etc.; hopefully I haven’t made too many mistakes here.</p>
<p>The Niddesa uses the same lists of synonyms and similes to explain similar or identical phrases and passages, sometimes several times within the same chapter. For readability, I have omitted some stock passages which are repeated verbatim, as well as concluding sentences of each paragraph when they simply repeat the first sentence, and concluding repetitions after the explanation of each verse. Without these omissions, the book would be at least twice as long as it is now. Because of this, it makes more sense to read the translation from start to finish rather than referencing specific suttas out of order.</p>
<p>Included verse numbers are numbers of the verses as presented in the two parts of the Niddesa itself. Including separate verse numbers for each sutta, their places in the Sutta Nipāta, and/or chapter their chapters, would lead to a confusing mess, so I’ve chosen to omit them. Most of the suttas are less than twenty verses, so correlating verses between the Niddesa and different translations of the Sutta Nipāta should be straightforward for the reader.</p>
<p>References to other texts were primarily added in the Chinese version and are in square brackets using common abbreviations (DN, Jat., etc.); statements of who is speaking a given stanza are also in square brackets; I have put comments, clarifications, and marks of unclear passages in parentheses.</p>

<p>“Greed is the cause of no benefit, and greed is the one which shakes the heart,<br />

Foolishness is the cause of no benefit, foolishness is the one that shakes the heart,<br />
horror arises from it, and people don’t realize it.<br />
Fools don’t know the benefits, fools can’t see the Dhamma,<br />
At that time he was a blind dark one: anyone who can be conquered.”</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One [SN.3.2]: “King! When the three dhammas within a man arise, disadvantage, suffering, and restlessness arise. Which three are there? King!

When the foolishness within the man arises, ….”</p>

The other side is called non-living, Nibbāna, that is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of all attachments, the cessation of craving, greed, extinction, and Nibbāna. “Can go to the other shore,” can reach the other shore; can arrive at the other shore; can testify to the other shore. “Anyone who has reached the other shore,” whoever wants to go to the other shore, he is the one who has reached the other shore; whoever goes to the other shore, he is also the one who has reached the other shore; whoever has reached the other shore, he is also the one who has reached the other shore.</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One: [SN.35.238]<br />
“I have crossed to the other shore, and the Brāhmaṇa is standing on the high ground. Bhikkhus!” ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is a synonym for an Arahant." He has proven to reach the other shore; those on the other shore; those who have reached the other shore through practice; …by testifying; …by the knowledge of all dhammas; …by the knowledge of all suffering; …by abandoning all pollution; …by the practice of the Four Holy Paths; those who testify of destruction reach the other shore; the one who waits until reaching the other shore, he is the free reacher in the precepts, the highest arrival; free in the holy determination he is the one who has reached the other side; at the confines of sanctity, the highest arrival; at the holy liberation, the highest arrival, he is the one who has reached the other shore; those who have reached the other shore, have reached the ultimate (target); …the ultimate…, the end; …the boundary (ultimate); …the terminator; …the rescue; …the refuge; …the shelter; …no terror; …no death; …undeath; …the person who has reached undeath, has reached Nibbāna. The person who has reached Nibbāna, he is the person who has descended, the person who has practiced, the person who has completed the journey, the person who has reached the direction, the person who has reached the end; those who have guarded the Brahma, those who have reached the highest view, those who have practiced the Path, those who have renounced pollution, those who have been unshakable, those who have testified to extinction, for him have been known, gathered and renounced, and the Path has been practiced and extinction has been testified, those who have been proven to be able to be known, those who have known what can be known, …renounced what should be renounced, …practiced what should be practiced, …testified what should be testified.</p>

<h3 id="the-cave">2. The Cave</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>7 · Stuck in the cave, covered by many (defilements),<br />
Sunk in foolishness,<br />
That kind of person is far away (from seclusion),<br />
Because desires in the world are not easy to give up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In the cave, covered by many”: “Cave,” like an animal is in a closed cave. The cave is called the body, “body” or “cave” or "“accumulation” or “boat” or “cart” or “flag” or “anthill” or “castle” or “nest” or “hut” or “tumor” or “urn” (or “elephant”), these are bodies, which are synonyms for “stuck in the cave;” in the cave he is stuck, entangled, suspended, attached, fixed, obstructed, such as an item is stuck or entangled on a wall pile or wall hook, suspended, attached, fixed, and obstructed. Similarly, in the cave he is stuck, entangled, suspended, attached, fixed, and obstructed.</p>
<p>This is said by the Blessed One: [SN.23.2-3]<br />
“Rādha! All the desires, greed, joy, thirst, love, clinging, attachment, holding, potential tendency of troubles, clinging there, and strong clinging there, these are called ‘beings;’ Rādha! …feeling.., perception, …choice, consciousness…, is called ‘all beings.’” “Sentient being” is a synonym for “adhesion” which means stuck in the cave. “Covered by many comprehensively,” covered by many pollutions, covered by greed, …hatred, delusion, anger, resentment, hidden evil, domineering, jealousy, stinginess, fraud, cunning, stubbornness, passion, sloth, extreme sloth, torpor, indulgence; covered by all pollution, all evil deeds, all troubles, all scorching heat, all irritations, covered by all bad practices, expanded coverage, upper coverage, obstruction (blocking), enveloping, obstructing, closing, covering.</p>
<p>“The person who stays has sunk in ignorance”: When people stay, the greedy person stays because of greed; the angry person stays because of anger; the foolish person stays because of ignorance; the tied (bonded) person stays because of conceit; the clinging person stays because of seeing; the person who comes to chaos stays because of being scattered; the person who does not come to the conclusion stays because of doubt; the person who comes to the fortitude stays because of the potential trend of troubles.</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus! There are forms that can be recognized by the eye, that are desirable, lovely, desirable, attractive, accommodating, and accompanied by greed. If the bhikkhus rejoice, welcome, and cling to them, they should know, ‘My skillfulness is declining, this is what the Blessed One calls decline.’ Bhikkhus! There is a sound that can be recognized by the ear…, smell that can be recognized by the nose…, taste that can be recognized by the tongue…, touch that can be known by the body…, (dhamma) that can be known by the consciousness, which makes people desire; if the bhikkhu rejoices, welcomes….” [SN.35.98]</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus! When consciousness abides with form, it stays in form, stands on form, is supported by form, and with a sprinkle of joy in it, it will grow and expand. Bhikkhus! When consciousness abides with feeling…, …perceiving….” [SN.22.53]</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus! If there is greed, joy, and thirst in material food, so consciousness establishes and grows; where consciousness establishes and grows, so there is the birth of name and form; where there is the birth of name and form, so there are deeds; where there is the growth of the deeds, so there is the birth of future rebirth; where there is the birth of future rebirth, so there is future birth, aging, and death; where there are future birth, aging, and death, Bhikkhus! I say: ‘There is sadness, sorrow, and despair.’” [SN.12.64]</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus! If in touch…. Bhikkhus! If desire for contact…. Bhikkhus! If there is greed, joy, and thirst for contact as nutriment…, I say ‘There is sadness, sorrow, and despair.’” [SN.12.64]</p>
<p>“Sinking in foolishness,” foolishness is called the five desires: the form which can be recognized by the eye, desirable, lovely, agreeable, attractive-looking, accompanied by desires, and greed for form; sound…, smell…, taste…, touch…. Why is foolishness called the five desires? Most days, people become foolish, ignorant, and confused in the five desires, becoming foolish, ignorant, and confused, hindered, enveloped, obstructed, closed, covered, hidden; for that reason, foolishness is called the five desires. “Sink in the foolishness,” sinking, entering, sneaking into, and falling into the foolishness.</p>
<p>“For someone like that, he is really far away”: “Far away,” there are three types of distance: body distance, heart distance, and clinging distance. What is body distance? Here, bhikkhus live close and alone: in the woods, under the trees, in mountains, caves, cemeteries, forests, open fields, straw piles, living far away with the body [Ni.14, 150], he walks alone, stands alone, sits alone, lies alone, enters the village alone for alms, returning alone, sitting alone in a quiet place, alone performing prayers, walking, staying, acting, going on, guarding, surviving, and living alone, is to be away with the body.</p>
<p>What is the mind (heart) away? The mind of the person who enters the first jhāna has moved away from the covers, the mind of the person who has entered the second jhāna has been separated from the search and service, the heart of the person who has entered the third jhāna has been separated from happiness, the heart of the person who has entered the fourth jhāna has been separated from happiness and suffering, the mind of the person who has entered the boundless void has already thought about opposing things and is away from all kinds of desires, the heart of the person who has entered the boundlessness of consciousness has wanted to be far away from the boundless void, the mind of the person who has entered nothingness has thought to stay away from the boundlessness of consciousness, and the mind of the person who has no thoughts has wanted to stay away from nothingness. The mind of the Sotāpanna person has changed from seeing, suspicious, forbidden, seeing the potential trend of defilement, the potential trend of doubt defilement, and the same. The pollution of existence is far away. The heart of the one who has come has changed from the rough desire and greed knot, the disgust knot, the latent tendency of the rough desire, greed and trouble, the potential trend of disgust and trouble, and the pollution of the same existence. The remaining knots of desire and greed, disgust, from the remaining potential trends of desire, greed, disgust, and the pollution that exist with them, the Arahant’s heart has changed from formless greed, conceit, abandonment, ignorance, and conceit trouble potential, the tendency, the latent tendency of greed and defilements, the latent tendency of ignorance defilements, and the pollution that coexists with and the distance from the outside and everything. This is the distance from the mind.</p>
<p>What is keeping (clinging) away? Dependence is called pollution and various aggregates and various works; dependence distance is called non-living, Nibbāna, that is the cessation of all actions, the cessation of all dependence, the extinction of craving, greed, extinguishment, and Nibbāna. This is to stay away. The distance of the body belongs to the continuous separation of the body and the willingness to leave the desire; the distance of the mind belongs to the purity of the heart and the highest purity; the separation of the clinging belongs to the unattached person, who comes to the liberation.</p>
<p>“He is indeed far away,” where he is stuck in the cave, so covered by so many, so sunken in foolishness, he is far away from the body; also far away from the heart; also far away from dependence, very far away, not near; at the place being pulled away. “Like that kind of person,” like that, belong to that dwelling, that kind, similar to that, the one who has sunk in foolishness.</p>
<p>“Because it is not easy to give up the desires in the world”: “Desire,” there are two kinds of desires: the desire of things and the desire of pollution. What are the desires of things? …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>What is the desire for pollution? …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“Seeing those roots of desire,<br />
Wanting to be produced by thought (intention),<br />
I will not think of them,<br />
So desire will not exist.”<br />
[Jat.8.421]</p>
<p>These are called the desire for pollution. “In the world”: …(omitted, see previous sections). “Because it is really not easy to give up the world of desire”: Because in the world of desire it is hard to give up, hard to disconnect, hard to break (conquer), hard to untie, hard to unravel, hard to release, difficult to escape, difficult to overcome, difficult to take off, and difficult to pass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8 · Being bound by the pleasure of having what they want,<br />
They are hard to get rid of because there is no freedom from other people,<br />
Looking forward to later or even back to the past,<br />
They look forward to these desires or those of the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Being bound by the pleasure of having because of wanting”: Want is called craving, that is greed…, unwholesome roots. “With the cause of wanting,” with wanting as the cause, wanting as the reason, wanting as the condition, wanting as the root cause.</p>
<p>“Being bound by happiness,” One kind of happiness: happiness; two kinds of happiness: happiness and satisfying things; three kinds of happiness: youth, freedom from disease, and life; four kinds of happiness: gain, fame, appreciation, and peace; five kinds of happiness: desirable form, desirable sound, desirable smell, desirable taste, desirable touch; six kinds: of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind. To be bound by the pleasure of happiness: bound by the joy of pleasure, bound by the satisfaction, bound by the youth, bound by the freedom from disease, bound by the life, bound by the profit, bound by the reputation, to be bound to admiration, to be bound to comfort; to be tied to the desired form, to sound, smell, taste, touch; to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body; bound, tied, attached, fixed, obstructed.</p>
<p>“They are hard to get rid of because they are not freed by others”: They are hard to get rid of things with pleasure, or all beings are difficult to relieve. How is it difficult for them to relieve pleasure in things? Pleasure is hard to get rid of, satisfying things are hard to get rid of, youth is hard to get rid of, …; difficult to break away, difficult to dissolve, difficult to release, difficult to unlock, difficult to overcome, difficult to pass.</p>
<p>How is it that beings are difficult to relieve here? It is difficult for sentient beings to get rid of pleasure, for sentient beings to be released from satisfying things, for sentient beings to be released from youth, …; it’s hard to pull out, it’s hard to pull out completely, it’s hard to rise, it’s hard to rise completely, difficult to unlock, difficult to release…, difficult to pass.</p>
<p>“Because they are not free by other people,” those who fell into the mud themselves cannot pull out the others who fell into the mud. This was said by the Blessed One: “Cunda! ‘I am the one who is in the quagmire and will pull out the others in the quagmire.’ This is impossible. Cunda! ‘Oneself is an unregulated, untrained, and non-Nibbāna one, and will make others tune, train, and attain Nibbāna.’ This is impossible.” [MN.8]</p>
<p>Or, you don’t have any other liberators; those who can be liberated, use their own power, with their own strength, with their own vitality, with their own efforts, with their own forces, with their own strength, with their own human power, with their own human vitality, with their own human efforts, with their own correct way, following the way, the non-opposite way, according to the right way, and the way according to the Dhamma, they can be liberated when they practice.</p>
<p>This is also said by the Blessed One: [Ni.22]<br />
“I will not be able liberate, Dhotaka, anyone who doubts in the world,<br />
When you know the best Dhamma, then you will get through this torrent.”</p>
<p>This is also said by the Blessed One: [Dph.12, 165]<br />
“He has done evil, he is polluted,<br />
He who does do not do evil, he comes pure,<br />
Purity and impurity are separate, one cannot make the other pure.”</p>
<p>This was also said by the Blessed One: “Similarly, Brāhmaṇa, Nibbāna stays and abides, the path which leads to Nibbāna stays and abides, and my persuasion (teaching) stays and abides. However, when my disciples are taught and admonished in this way, some of them reach the ultimate end of Nibbāna, and some do not reach. Brāhmaṇa, What can I do here? Brāhmaṇa, The Tathāgata is the guide. [MN.107] The Buddha only told (directed) the way, and when they practice it by themselves, they could be free.”</p>
<p>“Looking forward to later, or even to the past”: Later is called the future, and the past is called the past. In addition, after clinging to the past, the future and the present are behind; after clinging to the future, the past and the present are in front. How is it to look forward to the past? “I had such a form in the past,” to find joy there [MN.132]; “I had such feelings in the past…, I had such thoughts in the past…, I had this kind of behavior in the past…, I had this kind of knowledge in the past.” Looking for joy there, this is to look forward to the past.</p>
<p>Or, “My eyes were like that, and my forms were like that.” There, consciousness is bound by desire and greed; when consciousness is bound by desire and greed, it rejoices; when it is rejoiced, this is also an expectation of the past. “My ears were like that, and my voice was like that.” …, “my nose…, smell…, …, …tongue, …taste…, …body, …touch”…, mind…, dhammas…." There, consciousness is bound by desire and greed; when consciousness is bound by desire and greed, it rejoices; when it rejoiced [MN.133], this is also an expectation from the past.</p>
<p>Or, whoever laughed, talked, and played with women before, he enjoys it, desires it, and comes to happiness because of it [AN.7.50], which is also looking forward to the past.</p>
<p>How is it to look forward to later? “I will look like this in the future.” Looking for joy there, “I will have this feeling in the future. …I will think so in the future. …I will do this in the future. …I will have this knowledge in the future.” Looking for joy there, this is to look forward to later.</p>
<p>Or, “My eyes will be like that in the future, and my forms will be like that.” Have hope of the unobtained heart, and rejoice in the hope of the heart; when you rejoice in it, this is the expectation for later. “My ears….” Hope of the unobtained heart …, this is also the expectation for later.</p>
<p>Or, “I will become (into) the heaven, or one of the heavens, with this virtue, prohibition, asceticism, and Brahma.” Hope of the unobtained heart….</p>
<p>“Waiting for these desires, or looking to the past”: “In these desires,” in the present five desires, wanting, receiving, aspiring, longing, and praying. Or to the past, looking eagerly, eagerly looking forward to, begging for, and begging on the past five desires.</p>

<p>9 · Those who are greedy and enthusiastic in desire are ignorant,<br />
And those who are stingy are fixed on the wrong,<br />
When suffering results, they weep:<br />
Where will we be after we die from here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Those who are greedy and enthusiastic in desire are ignorant”: “Desire,” There are two kinds of desires…. Craving is called craving, which is greed…. Greed, craving, and being tied to the desire of things with the desire of the pollution knot, being fascinated, tainted, attached, fixed, obstructed.</p>
<p>“Enthusiasts,” whoever seeks, searches, and asks all over the desires, this character, the more, the serious, the target, the hardworking, the inclined, and the overcomer, those who increase, they are passionate ones. Anyone who seeks, searches, and asks in all forms…, ..sounds…, smells, tastes, touches…. Those who focus on that, those who take that as the object, those who work hard, those who incline toward them, those who overcome them, those who increase them, they are also passionate ones. Anyone who gets in the forms because of thirst…, in the sound…, smell, taste, touch, …they are also enthusiasts in desire. Whoever is used in the forms…. For example, critics are keen to criticize, workers are keen to do work, those who walk in the village are keen on walking in the village, and meditators are keen on meditation. In the same way, whoever seeks…, they are passionate ones. Where in all forms because of thirst, seeking, searching, begging all over…, …in sound…, smell, taste, touch…. Anyone who gets in the forms…. Whosoever is used in the forms…, they are also enthusiasts in desire.</p>
<p>“Ignorance,” most days, people become foolish…(omitted). Those who are greedy and passionate about desires are ignorant.</p>
<p>“The stingy are fixed on the wrong”: “The stingy,” “they go down” are the stingy; “the miserly” is also called the stingy; “not to care about the words and ways of the Buddha’s disciples and teachings” is a stingy one. How is “they go down” as a stingy one? They go to hell; they go to the animal world; they go to the evil world, this is “they go down.” How is a “miserly person” also called a stingy person? There are five kinds of stingy: stingy in dwelling, in home, of gain, of praise, of Dhamma, stingy appearance, stingy state, greed, miserly, petty, and heart-tight state are called stingy. In addition, miserliness is also stingy; world stinginess is also stingy; stinginess in views is also stingy. With this stinginess and intolerance, people become illiberal, so they are called stingy. How is it “not to care about the words, language, and teachings of Buddha disciples” as stingy? The words, ways of speaking, teaching, and admonitions of Buddha’s disciples, they don’t care, don’t want to listen, don’t listen to them, don’t need to know the words, don’t want to hear, don’t need to know them.</p>
<p>“They are fixed on the wrong,” fixed in the wrong body kamma, fixed in the wrong language kamma, fixed in the wrong mental kamma, fixed in the wrong killing, fixed in taking without giving, fixed in unrighteous lewdness, fixed in unrighteous deceit, in unrighteous divisive language…, vulgar language…, obscene language, greed, malice, view, deeds, five desires, five covers, deeply fixed, stuck, stopped, entered, stained, turned towards, attached, obstructed, blocked.</p>
<p>“When there is suffering, they weep.” “When there is suffering,” it means that suffering has been reached, the demon has been reached, death has been reached, and death is close. “They are weeping,” they grumble, weep, are sad, tired, grieve, pound their breasts and cry, and come to confusion.</p>
<p>“Where will we exist after we die from here”: “Where will we exist after we die from here? Will we be hell-fallen, beast-fallen, ghost-fallen, will we be people, will we become gods, formed ones, formless ones, become thinkers, non-thinkers, non-thinking ones.” “Do we exist in the future? Do we not exist in the future life? What will we be in the future life? What will our future life be like? What will we be in the future life, and what will (later) become?” Leap-into doubters, jump-into skeptics, arise doubts, they grumble, weep….</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10 · So here, people should learn,<br />
And they should know that anything “wrong” in the world,<br />
For that reason one should not do wrong,<br />
Because wise people say that this life is short.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Therefore people should learn here”: “Therefore,” With that reason, that cause, that condition cause, when you see this fault in desire. “Should learn,” there are three kinds of learning: increasing precept learning, increasing mind learning, increasing wisdom learning.</p>
<p>What is to add to precepts? Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who lives and is protected by the self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient righteousness and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns after accepting from a teacher. Small precepts aggregate and large precept aggregates are the foundation of abstinence, the (self) inhibition of behavior, the entrance of self-control, the uppermost of good dhamma, etc., this is to increase precept learning.</p>
<p>What is to increase mind? Here, the bhikkhu lives in the first jhāna of reasoning and thinking after he is absent from desires and unwholesome Dhamma, and after detachment produces joy and happiness; he calms down reasoning and thinking, with confidence, and one mind, and after entering, he lives in no reasoning, the second jhāna of joy and happiness is born without waiting; concentration, which fades with joy and dwells in peace, has mindfulness and right knowledge, and feels happiness in the body, after entering, dwelling in, this holy disciple proclaims: “He is calm and possessed” in the third jhāna of “mindfulness and abiding in the bliss;” with the renunciation of pleasure and the renunciation of suffering, and the extinction of joy and sorrow in the past, after entering, dwells in where there is no suffering or unhappiness in the fourth jhāna, this is to increase the mind.</p>
<p>What is to increase wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a wise person, possessing the wisdom that leads to the arising and passing away; the holy, insight, and the complete extinction of suffering is (the wisdom), he truthfully knows “This is suffering.” I know “This is the collection of suffering.” I know “This is suffering.” I know “This is the path to suffering.” To know the truth: “These are troubles.” To know the truth: “This is a collection of troubles.” To know the truth: “This is the elimination of suffering.” To know the truth: “This is the path leading to suffering.” This is to increase wisdom.</p>
<p>These three studies should be learned when heading towards (noting); learning when knowing; learning when seeing; learning when introspecting; learning when establishing (decision) when the heart is established; learning when solving with faith; you should learn when you are vigorous; you should learn when mindfulness arises; you should learn when the mind has concentration; you should learn when you know with wisdom; you should learn when you know what should be known; when knowledge should be known; we should learn when we should be renounced; we should learn when we should be practiced; we should learn when we should be testified, we should practice, we should practice well, and we should learn when we hold and go on.</p>
<p>“Here” belongs to this view, belongs to this like, belongs to this inclination, in this attachment, in this dhamma, in this teaching, in this holy way, in the teachings of this master, in this individual, in this human world; that is called “here.” “People,” beings, human beings….</p>
<p>“You should know everything that is ‘incorrect’ in the world”: “Anything,” all completely, completely in every aspect, with no remaining ground, and the whole ground. This is the ubiquitous language, which is “anything.” “You should know the ‘incorrect,’” you should know that the improper body kamma is “incorrect,” you should know that the improper language kamma is “incorrect,” you should know that the improper mental kamma is “incorrect,” you should know the improper killing is “incorrect,” …, unjustly not given and taken…, evil…, lie, divisive words, vulgar language, obscene language, greed, malice, wrong views, wrong wrong behaviors, five desires, five wrong covers…: It should be known, it should be distinguished, and it should be understood. “In the world,” in the world of the suffering world….</p>
<p>“One should not do wrong, for that reason”: With the cause of wrong body kamma one should not do wrong; with the cause of wrong language kamma…; with the cause of wrong thinking, wrong hope, wrong desire…, one should not do wrong: should not be practiced, should not be fully practiced, should not be held after going on.</p>
<p>“Because the wise people say that this life is little (less, short)”: “Life” is the survival of life; the going-on of life, survival, and action; the guardian (keeper) of life and the root of life. In addition, life is short due to two factors: the limited life based on survival, or limited life based on natural finite life. How is the limited life of existence less? Living in the past heart moment, (but) not living now, not living in the future; living in the future heart moment, (but) not living now and not living in the past; living in the present heart moment now, (but) not living in the past, not living in the future.</p>
<p>“Life and individual, all (only) happiness and suffering,<br />
Taken with a single heart: it can turn around in an instant.<br />
Where the heavens exist, eighty-four thousand tribulations,<br />
But neither of them, combined to live by two hearts.<br />
Anyone who dies or survives here, the aggregates are destroyed,<br />
have gone, everything is, and the same cannot be restored.<br />
Those who are immediately destroyed, and those who are destroyed in the future,<br />
(And) those who are destroyed in the middle are not unequal in characteristics.<br />
He could not help but was born, he lives now,<br />
With the heart being destroyed, the world becomes dead, and it is the peace of the highest interest.<br />
They happen as downward (flowing) and are intended to change,<br />
They turn (such as) the uncut water flow, with six points as an edge.<br />
The destroyed ones come without storage, and there will be no accumulation in the future,<br />
And wherever arises, they survive, like mustard seeds at the tip of the cone (moment).<br />
To the arising dhammas, destruction is placed in front of them,<br />
The broken dhammas remain, and they do not mix with the previous ones.<br />
They come invisible, they see and leave from destruction,<br />
Like lightning in the sky, they arise and dissipate.”</p>
<p>How is the limited life of nature less? Life is the dependent of the breath; life is the dependent of the income; life is the dependent of the intake and exit; life is the dependent of the (four) species; life is the dependent of lumps of food; life is the dependent of the warmth; life is the dependent of the consciousness: These are fundamentally weak; the causes of these are also weak; those who rely on them are also weak; those who use them as power are also weak; the common foundation of these is also weak; these connections are also weak; these co-borns are also weak; everything connected with them is also weak; these are habitually weak to each other; these are not standing on each other; these are mutually destructive; there is no mutual shelter, and these don’t make each other stand; those who produce are not discovered.</p>
<p>“No one disappears because of anyone else, and these are indeed all destroyed, these are produced from before, and those who produced them have died before, the former and the latter have never seen each other.”</p>

<p>“Anyone who speaks of himself”: He is called himself. “Speak by yourself,” speak of yourself as “I am a ‘sufficient person,’ or a ‘restricted person,’ or ‘precept and prohibitions are enough’ …(omitted)…,” he says, talks, explains, said.</p>
<blockquote>

Does not boast “I am like this” in the precepts,<br />
The skillful people say that it is the Holy Dhamma,<br />
For him there is no increase anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Silent bhikkhus, those who are in a completely cooled state”: “silent,” the greed has subsided so the state is silent; the anger has subsided so the state is silent; …ignorance…, …resentment.., …domineering…, (omitted, see previous sections)…, all unwholesome contrived state has been silenced, calmed down, cooled down, the extinguished state, the cooled state, the departed state, and the cessation state are silent, still, calmed, cooled, stopped. “Bhikkhu,” the state of the destroyed seven dhammas is a Bhikkhu: seeing is destroyed, suspicion is destroyed, prohibition is destroyed, greed is destroyed, anger is destroyed, delusion is destroyed, sloth is destroyed, and those evil and unwholesome dhammas are destroyed; shunning the pollution, the others, the fear, the bitter fruit, old age and death in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One [Sn.3.6, 519]:<br />
“Take the path I have practiced to reach Nibbāna and transcend skeptics,<br />
After abandoning nothingness and existence,<br />
The one who has been completed, and the one who is extinct, is a Bhikkhu.”</p>
<p>“Silent Bhikkhus, those in a state of being completely cooled”: Those who make the state of greed extinguished are those in the state of being completely cooled, …anger…, …ignorance…, (omitted).</p>
<p>“I don’t boast about ‘I am like this’ in the precepts:”I am like this," the continuation of the sentences; the connection of the sentences; the consummation of the sentences; the combination of words; the connection of words; this is a second sentence; this is “I am like this.” “I don’t boast in the precepts.” Here, there is a type of boasting: I am a “restricted person,” …(omitted)…. In this way he does not boast or show off. He has been separated from boasting, has renounced, has abandoned, has given up, has been separated, has been freed, has renounced bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.</p>

<p>“For him increase (surge, growth) does not exist anywhere in the world”: “For him,” for the Arahant, for those who have exhausted troubles. “Surge,” there are seven surges: greed, aggression, delusion, sloth, seeing, pollution, kamma increases. For those people, these increases are not, do not exist, are not known, and have not been discovered; cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, burned by the fire of wisdom. “No matter where,” no matter where, wherever, inside or outside or (both) inside and outside. “In the world,” in the world of suffering, the world of humans, the world of heaven, the world of aggregates, the world of realms, the world of places.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>19 · All the dhammas that are fixed for him,<br />
Which are valued and impure,<br />
Who sees benefits in himself,<br />
Is a dependent who shakes the silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“All the dhammas that are fixed for him, which are valued”: “Fixed (constant) view,” there are two kinds of fixed views: …. “Proactive,” Proactive, pretentious, and cohabiting, are active. In addition, the impermanence, the action, the condition-born are the dhammas of the extinction, the dissipation, the fading, and the dhammas, are also active. “Whatever is for him” is for those who see evil. “Dhamma” It is called the sixty-two evil views.</p>
<p>“Being valued (and) impure”: “Being valued,” there are two kinds of importance: …. For him, the importance of thirst is not cut off, the importance of seeing has not been cut off, the state of the importance of thirst is not cut off, the state of the importance of seeing is not cut off, he puts thirst for love or seeing ahead before and walks, thirst as a flag, thirst as a pillar, thirst increases, seen as flag, seen as tower, seen as increase, following desire to love or see. “Existence,” to be, to be known, to have, to be discovered. “Impure,” impure, improper, unclean, polluted, contaminated.</p>
<p>“Whoever sees benefits in oneself”: “Oneself” is on the self. He is called (one who has the) evil view, and he sees two benefits of his own view: the benefit in life and the benefit in the afterlife. What is the life benefit of seeing (this view)? Every view that the master has, so do the disciples. For that view of the master, the disciples respect, admire, adore, and respect, because of that he gets clothes, food, shelter, patients’ necessities, and medical necessities, this is the immediate benefit of seeing. What is the afterlife benefit of seeing (this view)? “This seeing is enough to become the state of the dragon (dragon world), or the state of the golden-winged bird, or the state of the Yakkha, or the state of Asura, or the state of Gandhabba, or the state of the king, or the state of Indā, or the state of Brahma, or the state of heaven, this view is pure, clean, all pure; detachment, liberation, breaking away, from all over, to see them become pure, to become purified, to become pure; to be detached, to be liberated, to be freed, to see that I will become pure, to become purified, to become pure; to escape, be liberated, and be detached everywhere.” For the expectation of future fruit, this is the afterlife benefit of seeing. He sees, watches, stares, contemplates, and observes the two benefits of his own view.</p>
<p>“He is a dependent who shakes the stillness (silence)”: There are three kinds of stillness: ultimate stillness, temporal stillness, and worldly stillness. What is ultimate silence? Ultimate silence is called non-living, Nibbāna, where all those actions cease, all dependent cessation, the cessation of craving, greed, extinction, and Nibbāna, this is ultimate silence. What is temporal silence? For those who enter the first jhāna, the gazes are silenced; for those who enter the second jhāna, searching is silenced; for those who enter the third jhāna, their their joy is silenced; for those who enter the fourth jhāna, their happiness (and suffering) are quiet; for those who enter the boundless void (fifth/first immaterial), lust, thinking, and all kinds of desires are silenced; for those who enter the boundlessness of consciousness (sixth), the boundless void is quiet; for those who enter nothingness (seventh) it is said that knowledge has no bounds is silenced; for those who enter the non-imaginary place (eighth, neither perception nor non-perception) and wait, nothingness is silenced, this is the part of silence. What is worldly silence? The sixty-two evil views, the stillness of seeing is called secular stillness, and in this sense it is secular stillness: it has the meaning of “silence.” “He is a dependent shaking the stillness”: He is shaking stillness, strong shaking stillness, moving stillness, fluctuating stillness, impacting stillness, constructed stillness, fixed view, silence is impermanent, active, and conditioned; it is the dependent, stuck, adherent, trapped, afflicted, and mind-oriented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20 · The attachment to seeing (views) is indeed not easy to overcome:<br />
It is held tightly after being selected among Dhammas,<br />
Therefore, everyone rejects and holds<br />
The Dhamma in those attachments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The attachment to seeing (views) is indeed not easy to overcome”: The attachment to seeing, “The world is constant, this is real, and everything else is empty.” The persistence, clinging to the dwelling place of seeing (the view); “The world is very constant…,” …(omitted)… “The obsession of seeing is indeed not easy to overcome”: The obsession of seeing is indeed not easy to overcome, difficult to surpass, difficult to escape, difficult to transcend, difficult to pass, and difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>“After selecting among the Dhammas, it is held tightly”: “In the Dhamma,” in the sixty-two evil views. “After selection,” after decision, after judgment, after measurement, after evaluation, after judgment, after separation, after clarification. “To be grasped,” limited grasp, partial grasp, uppermost grasp, fixed amount grasp, accumulation grasp: this is true, truthful, facts, correctness, and not inverted, to be held, clenched, clinging, taken, believed to be understood.</p>
<p>“Therefore everyone, in those attachments”: “Therefore,” … “Everyone,” …. “In those attachments,” in those attachments of seeing (views).</p>
<p>“Rejection and holding of the Dhamma”: “Rejection,” he refuses for two reasons: he refuses by interruption by others, or he refuses when it is not reached (by him). How to refuse by interruption by others? Judgment: That master is not the all wise man, the Dhamma is not said to be good, (its) groups (of people) are not those who do what is good, seeing is not good, the path is not set up by the good, the path is not detached, there is no purity here, or purification, or all over pure; or free, or liberated, or all out, it’s inferior, despicable, low, trivial, inferior intent, insignificant; and this is “interrupted by others.” In this way, when interrupted, he rejects the master, the narration of the Dhamma, the group, and the meeting, refuse the path, reject the Path, so that it is “interrupted by others.” How does he refuse when it is not reached (by him)? He rejects when the precept is not reached, he rejects when the prohibition is not reached, and when the precept and prohibition are not reached, he refuses, so he refuses when it is not reached. “And grasping,” he grasps the master, grasps the narration, grasps the group, grasps the view, grasps the way, grasps the path, he grasps, persists.</p>

<p>21 · For those who are cleansed,<br />
There is no place in the world where there are all kinds of views,<br />
After the cleansed one has abandoned deception and conceit,<br />
What would he fall into?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“For those who are cleansed, there is indeed no place in the world, where there are all kinds of (incorrect) views (of existence)”: “Cleansing,” cleansing is called wisdom, which is wisdom…(omitted) For what reason is cleansed called Wisdom? With that wisdom, the evil deeds of the body are shaken off, cleansed, completely cleansed, and washed away; the evil deeds of speech…; malevolent acts…, greed…; anger, ignorance, …(omitted)…; all pollution, all evil deeds, all troubles, all scorching heat, all heat troubles, all unwholesome deeds are shaken off, washed, completely washed, and separated by washing, for this reason cleansing is called wisdom.</p>

<p>Or, all pollution, all evil deeds, all afflictions, all scorching heat, all heat afflictions, all unwholesome deeds are shaken off, cleansed, completely cleansed, and separated by cleansing by the eight holy paths, and the Arahant possesses, fully possesses, enters, fully enters, fully-sufficient, fully-satisfied, possessing these dhammas that can be cleansed. Therefore, the Arahant is a cleansed person. He is the one who shakes off the greed, the evil, the pollution, and the heat (irritation). “No matter where,” no matter where, anywhere, wherever, inside or outside or (both) inside and outside. “In the world,” in the world of the suffering world… (omitted).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of fixed views: the fixed views because of desire and the fixed views of seeing (views)… (omitted). “In all kinds of existence,” in all kinds of kamma, the desire to have again; in the desire to have, the form of existence; in the form of existence, the formlessness again; in the kamma of the formless existence, repeating again and again; in the repeated interest, in the rebirth; in the rebirth, the individual birth. For those who are cleansed, no matter where they are in the world, there are indeed no views, and there are (none of) all kinds of fixed views: for those who are cleansed, no matter where in the world, construction of all kinds of things, fixed, contrived, making cohabitation with views, he is not, does not exist, is not known, is not discovered, has been cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, burned by the fire of wisdom.</p>
<p>“The person who cleans up abandons deception and conceit”: Deception is called deception. Here, after a certain type of person performs evil deeds with the body; after the evil deeds with the language; after the evil deeds with the intention, the desire to hide the evil is established. He wants: “May he not know me (my deeds, etc.)!” He doesn’t want to know me!" Says “May he not know me!” working hard physically, “May he not know me!” [AN.6.45] In cases of deception, cross-border (violation), concealment, obfuscation, keeping secrets, hiding, concealing (keeping secrets all over), covering, covering all over, undisclosed acts, and covering up evil acts are called deceptions.</p>
<p>“Conceit,” one kind of conceit: that is the height of the heart; two kinds…: self praise is conceited, contempt for others is conceited; three: “I am the winner”…, “I am the same,” “I am the inferior;” four: to gain, to have fame, praise, and comfort; five: “I obtain the desired form,” “I obtain the desired sound,” smell…, taste…, touch….; six kinds: with eyes…, ears…, nose, tongue, body, …satisfaction of the mind makes one conceited; seven: conceit, arrogance, conceit and arrogance, humbleness, conceit of increase, conceit of self-reality, conceit of evil; eight: obtaining makes one conceited, not obtaining…, fame, no fame, praise, rebuke, happiness, and suffering; nine: the winner thinks: “I am the winner”…, the winner thinks: “I am the same,” the winner thinks: “I am the inferior”…; and equal think: “I am the winner,” the equal thinks: “I am the same,” the equal thinks: “I am the inferior,” the inferior thinks: “I am the winner,” the inferior thinks: “I am the same,” the inferior thinks: “I am the inferior;” ten kinds…: here, by certain birth, or surname, or good family, or beauty like a lotus, or property, or research (acquisition), or career, or craftsmanship, or study, or by what you hear, or by arguing, or by something to make one conceited; anyone who, like this, with this kind of heart conceit, thinking, perceiving the situation, high tribute, high conceit, as a banner, as a flag, heart vanity is called conceited. “The cleansed one abandons the deceit and conceit”: After the cleansed one abandons, after discarding, after being driven away, after finishing, and making it go to non-existence.</p>
<p>“He is a non-attached person, what would he fall into?”: “Attachment,” there are two kinds of attachments…. For him, the attachment to love has been cut off; the attachment to seeing (views) has been cut off, the state of attachment to seeing has been cut off; not-attached people will fall in with what greed, with what aversion, with what delusion, with what conceit, with what perception, with what doubt, what kind of potential trouble, and become the “infected,” or “disgusting,” or “ignorant,” or “bound,” or “attacker,” or “coming to the scattered chaos,” or “coming to the unsatisfactory,” or “coming to the stalwart?” What kind of state will the state where the deeds have been cut off and the deeds will fall into the interesting place and become “in hell,” or “the animal world,” or “hungry ghost world,” or “human,” or “heaven,” or “formed,” or “formless,” or “thinking,” or “not thinking,” or “neither a thinker nor a thoughtless one?” He has no cause, no predestiny, and no factors that will fall into it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“Involved people have indeed reached controversy in all dhammas”: “Involvement,” there are two kinds of involvement: the craving and seeing…. For him, the involvement of thirst has not been cut off; the involvement of seeing has not been cut off, in the state of being unbroken, the state of involvement of seeing reached disputes in the dhamma, becoming the “infected,” or the “disgusting,” or the “stupid,” or the “bound,” or the “holding,” or “coming to disorganization,” or “coming to the undesirable,” or “coming to the fortitude,” the state of the unremoved, the unresolved state of the creations, in the interest of the controversy, becomes the “fall to hell people,” or “those who fell into the animal world,” or “those who fell into the hungry ghost world,” or “human,” or “heaven,” or “formed,” or “formless,” or “thinking,” or " the non-thinking person, or the “neither the thinking nor non-thinking person,” he arrives, holds, grasps, and persists.</p>
<p>“How and by what can be said of the non-attached one”: “Attachment,” there are two kinds of attachment: …. For him, the attachment of thirst has been cut off…; with what greed…, in terms of the underlying tendency of trouble, can you say that the non-attachment person is the “infected,” or the “disgusting,” or the “ignorant,” or the “bound,” or the “attacker,” or “coming to disorganization,” or “coming to the unsatisfactory,” or “coming to the stalwart?” What can be said of the state in which the deeds have been cut off…. He has no cause, no fate, there are no factors that can be spoken of, can be talked of, can be explained, and can be said.</p>
<p>“Taking and rejecting do not exist for him”: The “taking” is for “me,” he does not have this; the “rejection” is for the extinction, he does not have this; the “taking” is the grasping, …and the “rejection” is the one that should be released…. Anything that should be held, there is something that should be released; everything that should be released, there are those that should be held. Taking and rejecting has been surpassed, and the Arahant has surpassed consciousness and retreat. He is a person who has descended into a state, who has practiced, who has completed the journey, who has reached the direction, the cycle of life and death, without his rebirth.</p>
<p>“In this life he sweeps away all views”: For him, the sixty-two evil views have been cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, burned by the fire of wisdom, and all evil views, he swept, shook off, shakes off completely, shakes down, gives up, drives away,s make to end, makes them to go to non-existence, in this life.</p>

<p>“Brāhmaṇas are not pure from others, in what they see, hear, precepts and prohibitions or perceptions”: “Not” means negation. “Brāhmaṇa,” the state of excluding of seven dhammas is a Brāhmaṇa: …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>The Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 524]<br />
“After all evil is eliminated,<br />
Standing the spotless, virtuous state,<br />
After he transcends reincarnation,<br />

Those who are not dependent,<br />
Like this can be called Brāhmaṇa.”</p>
<p>“Brāhmaṇas do not say purity is from others,” With other things …, the Brāhmaṇa does not speak, say, talk, or explain, does not say.</p>
<p>“In what they see, hear, precepts and prohibition, or perceptions.” Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas regard seeing as pure. They identify seeing certain forms as auspicious, and believe that seeing certain forms as unlucky. What kind of sight do they believe is auspicious? In the early morning they saw the auspicious forms: seeing sparrows, seeing the gorgeous and colorful Marmelos trees, …pregnant women, …boy on the shoulders of a man, full urns, Samaṇas, horses, horse carts, bulls, oxen; they believe that seeing things like that is auspicious. What kinds of sights do they believe are unlucky? Seeing the straw pile, …the butter urn, the empty urn, the dancers, the nude fake Samaṇas, the mule, the donkey carriage ride, the single-harness ride, the one-eyed person, hand deformity, the lame person, the half-body, the elderly, and the sick; they believe that it is unlucky to see things like that. These are those Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas who see what they see as pure.</p>
<p>Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas regard what they hear is pure. They believe that hearing certain sounds is auspicious, and they believe that hearing certain sounds is unlucky. Which sounds do they believe are auspicious? In the early morning they heard an auspicious voice: “Prosperity,” or “precious,” or “full,” or “gorgeous,” or “worry-free,” or “good will,” or “good star,” or “good luck,” or “lucky,” or “luck increase;” they believe that hearing sounds like this is auspicious. Which sounds do they believe are unlucky? “One-eye,” or “hand deformity,” or “lame,” or “half-body,” or “elderly,” or “patient (sick),” or “dead,” or “cut,” or “broken,” or “burned,” or “disappeared,” or “none;” they believe that hearing sounds like this is unlucky.</p>
<p>Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas regard precepts as purity. They believe that the degree of precept, the degree of (self) restraint, the degree of self-control, and the degree of non-violation are pure, clean…. Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍika said: Homeowner! I have established that the men who possess the four methods are those who have goodness, the highest of goodness, those who obtain the supreme attainment, and the Samaṇa (does not exist) who cannot overcome them. Which four? Homeowner! Here, he does not act evil deeds, does not speak evil words, does not intend with evil intentions, does not live a life of evil, owner! I have established that the man who possesses these four methods is the one who has goodness, the supreme one who is good, the one who is supremely attained, and the unsurpassable Samaṇa [MN.78]. Similarly, some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas regard precepts as pure.</p>
<p>Some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas regard the prohibition as pure.

They touch the earth, in the early morning, touch grass, cow dung, turtle, hoe, sesame carrier, chew auspicious sesame seeds, chew auspicious oil, chew auspicious tooth wood, bathe with auspicious soil, wear auspicious clothes, and wrap a lucky headscarf.</p>
<p>“In what you see, hear, precepts and prohibitions, or perception,” a Brāhmaṇa does not say purity is in what he sees; he does not say purity is in what he hears; he is not pure by precepts; he is not pure by prohibitions; and he is not (pure) by what he feels. Purity means purity; to not tell, not talk, not explain, not speak.</p>
<p>“Not to be polluted in virtue and evil”: Virtue is called all the good works of the three realms, and non-benefit (evil) is called all unwholesome (works). Because the good deeds and non-blessings and immovable deeds are cut off, the root has been cut off…(omitted, see previous sections), in this case, it is not contaminated, not strongly contaminated, not closely contaminated in virtue and evil, no longer contaminated, no longer strongly contaminated, no longer contaminated closely. He has left, has departed, has been freed, has been freed from bondage, he dwells with an unrestrained heart.</p>
<p>“Abandon what you take, and don’t make (anything) here”: “Abandon what you take” means forsaking your vision; “abandon what you take” means forsaking perseverance; “abandon what you take” means holding on because of craving for love and seeing; all that is held, clinging, taking, and faithful to are abandoned, spit out, released, dismissed, and discontinued by him. “Those who do not make (anything) here,” the one that is not making merit, the one that is not made to be born, the one that is not to be produced, the one that is not making to arise.</p>

The person who is free from greed is called the supreme greed, greed, lust, bound, obsessed, tainted, attached, fixed, and obstructed in the realm of materiality and non-materiality. “There are those who are not greedy, and those who are not free from greed.” Because desire, greed, formed greed and formless greed have been cut off, the roots have been cut off, like a palm tree without roots, becoming a non-living thing for the future, in this case, there are those who are greedy, and those who are not greedy.</p>

They are dhammas of destruction, dissolution, fading, extinction, and change. All things that you see are also impermanent… (omitted). This is said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus! Have you seen that all things are constant, strong, eternal, unchangeable, everlasting?” “No, Blessed One!” “Bhikkhus! Good! Bhikkhus! Nor have I seen (that things are) the constant, solid, eternal, unchangeable, and everlasting.” [MN.22] Permanent, solid, eternal, unchanging possessions, they do not, do not exist, are not known, and cannot be obtained.</p>

Separation, parting, and dissociation from all that you love and find agreeable. Ānanda! Here, how can it be obtained: ‘Anything that is born, exists, does something, or corrupts, must not be destroyed.’ This is impossible!” [DN.16] It belongs to the former aggregates, realms, and changeability and mutation; the subsequent aggregates, realms, and rotations.</p>

Those bhikkhus who have not obeyed this dhamma, they do not come to grow or expand in this dhamma. But, Bhikkhus!

<p>“(On) encounter with the cleansed one, you will definitely not be able to move forward”: It is impossible for Pasūra, the marcher, to meet with the cleansed one, the Buddha and the Blessed One, rendezvous, discuss after the dispute, talk together, and enter the discussion. What’s the reason? The demonstrator Pasūra is inferior, despicable, low, inferior intent, insignificant, and the Blessed One is the first, the most triumphant, the superior, the uppermost, the supreme, the highest. For example, it is impossible for a rabbit to meet with a drunk elephant and compete after meeting; for example, it is impossible for a jackal to compete with a lion, to meet together with the beast king, meet and compete after meeting; …a young, suckling calf cannot meet with a bull…; …a crow cannot meet with the golden-winged bird…; …an outcast cannot meet with the king…; …a mud ghost cannot meet with Indā…; just like this, for the marcher Pasūra it is impossible to meet, rendezvous, discuss after the competition, talk together, and enter into discussions with the cleansed one, the Buddha and the Blessed One. What is the reason? The demonstrator Pasūra is the one who is inferior, …. Those who benefit from wisdom, those who perceive wisdom, those who are clever, those who have developed wisdom, those who have proven to be unimpeded, those who have reached the four fearless ones, those who hold ten powers, those who are like bulls, those who are like lions, those who are virtuous people, those who have great wealth, those who have boundless wisdom, those who have boundless brilliance, those who have boundless reputation, the rich, the wealthy, the guides, the moderators, the comforters, the informers, those who make them consider, those who make them see, the one who makes it clear, the Blessed One is indeed the founder of the unborn Path, the producer of the unborn Path, the unannounced preacher, the one who knows the Path; in addition, (his) disciples now live in the companionship of the Path, and will be those who possess it in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One is indeed he Knower and Seer, who knows and sees; he is the one who is born with eyes, is born with wisdom, is born with Dhamma, and is born with Brahma; is an interpreter and promoter of righteousness, the immortal giver, Dhamma King, Tathāgata, there is no one that the Blessed One does not know, does not see, unknown, does not testify, does not touch with wisdom, the past, the future, and the present come to the Buddha with all the deeds. In the field of wisdom, any dhamma that should be guided to reason can be known: one’s own righteousness or other people’s righteousness or both, or the current righteousness or the righteousness of the next life or both, or deep or secret, or should be led to infer, or have been led to determine, or no-fault or pollution-free, or clear and pure or supreme interest, they all turn around in the Buddha’s wisdom.</p>
<p>All body kamma is transferred in the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One; all language kamma…; all mental kamma…; the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One about the past is barrier-free; ..future…; …present…; all that should be guided to infer is the reach of wisdom; all wisdom is guided to be inferred, and all that should be guided to be inferred is the ultimate wisdom; the ultimate wisdom is what is guided to be deduced, and there is no wisdom beyond what is guided to be deduced; there is no way to transcend the wisdom that is guided and deduced. These dhammas live in mutual restriction, such as two boxes, where the covers are completely in contact; the lower cover does not go over the upper one, and the upper cover does not go over the lower one; restricted to each other. (Similarly, ) all that should be guided… (omitted); these dhammas live in mutual restriction.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred in all the Dhamma, all the Dhamma is the Buddha, the Blessed One’s turning is to belong, the hope is to belong, the intention is to belong, the mind is to arise, the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred to all living beings, the Blessed One Know the intentions of all living beings, know the potential tendency of troubles, know the behavior, know the solution, know about the less dusty, the more dusty; the rooted, the dull rooted, the good deeds, the evil deeds, and the teachability and unteachability of beings; capable and incapable sentient beings, including the world of heaven, demon, and Brāhmaṇa; generations of Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven, and man all revolve in the wisdom of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Just as all fish, turtles, and even big fish swallowing boats revolve in the sea, the same is true of the world including heaven, demon, and Brāhmaṇa; generations including Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven, and human all revolve in the wisdom of Buddha. Such as any bird and even the golden-winged birds turned around in the field of space. In the same way, those who have the same wisdom as Sāriputta also revolve around in the field of Buddha wisdom. The wisdom of the Buddha is pervasive and transcends heaven and human (worlds).</p>
<p>Those wise khattiya, wise Brāhmaṇas, wise homeowners (laypeople), wise Samaṇas, wise dissidents, sharp breakers who want to do evil views with a wise attitude, they prepare problems later to see and ask hidden and secret questions of the Tathāgata; those questions were discussed and answered by the Blessed One with reasons, (and they) abandoned them, and became the (disciples) of the Blessed One. At that time, the Blessed One was there to shine with wisdom. [Ps.21]</p>

<p>Homeowner! How does one bring up close associates in the village? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu lives in socializing with his family members, sharing joys and sorrows: when they are happy, when they are suffering, he is involved in (their) affairs and obligations by himself, homeowner! In this way, intimate associates arise in the village.</p>
<p>Homeowner! How can there be no close associates in the village? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu lives without socializing with his family members, in joys and sorrows: not when they are happy, not when they are suffering, he does not consider himself involved in (their) affairs and obligations, homeowner! In this way, no intimate associates arise in the village.</p>
<p>Homeowner! How are the desires not given up? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu is not free from greed, desire, love, passion, and thirst in desire, homeowner! This is the one who has not given up all desires.</p>
<p>Homeowner! What is the one who has been given up? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu has been detached from greed, love, desire, irritation, and thirst in desire, homeowner! This is the one who has been given up.</p>
<p>Homeowner! What is the hopeful one? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu thinks like this: ‘I will have this form in the future.’ He looked for joy [MN.132] there; there will be such feelings…, there will be such thoughts…, there will be such behaviors….’ I will have such knowledge in the future.’ He was looking for joy there. Homeowner! This is the hopeful one.</p>
<p>Homeowner! What is the one who has no expectations? Homeowner! Here, a certain type of bhikkhu thinks like this: ‘I will have this form in the future. He is not looking for joy there; there will be such feelings….’ He is not looking for joy there. Homeowner! This is the one who has no expectations.</p>
<p>Homeowner! What is an interlocutor who argues with people? Homeowner! Here, someone is a talker like this: ‘You don’t know the dhamma…(omitted).’ Homeowner! This is the interlocutor who argues with people.</p>
<p>Homeowner! What is an interlocutor who does not argue with others? Homeowner! Here, someone is not a talker like this: ‘You don’t know this dhamma….’ Homeowner! This is an interlocutor who does not argue with others. In this way, homeowner! In the eight groups of questions asked by the Blessed One by Māgandiya:</p>
<p>‘After leaving his home,<br />
He became a traveller without a place to live.<br />
In the village, Muni did not make close contacts.<br />
Those whose desires have been eliminated,<br />
Those who do not have expectations,<br />
Will not engage in arguing discussions with others.’</p>
<p>Homeowner! The detailed rationale of what Blessed One said briefly should be understood in this way."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>80 · Those who are far away (secluded) in the world are able,<br />
And noble ones will not pick up and say those things,<br />
Like an aquatic thorn water lotus, not polluted by water and mud,<br />
Like this, Muni is is a silent one, a non-greedy person,<br />
And is not polluted in desire and the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In the world, those who are far away can do it”: Away from those, from those evil views. Far from those who have done evil with their bodies, those who have been emptied, and those who have been separated; those who have done evil with words…, evil with intentions…, with greed…. “Can do,” able to do, to live, to act, to go on, to protect, to exist, and to survive. “In the world,” in the world of mankind.</p>
<p>“Noble ones (nāgas; also meaning elephant) will not pick up and say those things afterwards”: “Noble ones,” “don’t commit crimes” for noble ones; “don’t go” for noble ones; “don’t come” for noble ones. What is “no crime” as a noble one? Crimes are called evil and unwholesome dhammas: those that are polluted, that there are re-existing, those that are fearful, those that suffer the consequences, and the ones that will die in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One [Sn.3.6, 527]:<br />
‘Do not commit any crimes in the world,<br />
After leaving all bonds and bonds,<br />
Not sticking to everything,<br />
Freed people like this are truly called noble ones.’</p>
<p>How is “not going” as a noble one? A noble one does not go because of not wanting; not because of terror; not because of greed; not because of hatred; not because of ignorance; not because of conceit; not because of views; not because of disbelief; not because of doubt; not because of potential troubles; not be carried away by quarrels (disharmony), walk, led, be taken.</p>
<p>How is “not coming” as a noble one? Any pollution that is cut off by the Sotāpanna Path, the pollution he no longer experiences, does not return, and does not go back; by the Sakadāgāmī Path…; by the Anāgāmī Path…; by the Arahant Path….</p>
<p>“Noble ones will not pick up and say those things”: “Noble ones will not hold, grasp, cling to, and persist in those bad views and then speak, tell, talk, explain, or say;”The world is everlasting… (omitted)." After, talking, saying, explaining, speaking.</p>
<p>“Like an aquatic thorn water lotus, not polluted by water and mud”: Water (elaṃ) is called water (udaka); lotus (ambujaṃ) is called lotus (paduma); thorns are called thick-stemmed; water (vāri) is called water; lotus (vārijaṃ) is called lotus; water (jalaṃ) is called water; mud (paṅko) is called mud (kaddamo). For example, the aquatic lotus, which arises from water, is not contaminated by water and mud, not strongly contaminated, and not closely contaminated, no longer contaminated, no longer completely contaminated, no longer contaminated closely.</p>
<p>“Muni like this is a quiet, non-greedy person, and will not be polluted in desire and the world”: “Like this” is a metaphorical arrangement. “Muni,” …. “Silent,” Muni is silent (a proponent of silence), a medic, a refuge, a shelter, a non-terror one, an undeath one, an immortal, and a Nibbāna one. Muni is a silent one. “Non-greed,” Craving is called craving, that is greed…. For for whom this this greed is cut off, …, he is called the non-greed person; he is the non-greed person in appearance (form), in sound…, in smell…, …(omitted), …the dhammas that are seen, heard, perceived, and knowable, are those who are not greedy, those who are not bound, those who are not obsessed with, and are not sinful. Those who have departed from greed, those who have no greed, those who have abandoned greed, those who have eliminated greed, those who have been freed from greed, those who have renounced greed, those who have no greed, those who are not hungry, those who have cooled down, those who have become cool, those who feel happy, those who live as a Brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p>“Not to be polluted in desire and the world,” “Desire,” …. “In the world”: …. “Adhesion,” …. After Muni breaks off the adhesion of thirst and love, after breaking the adhesion of seeing, he will not be contaminated in what he sees; in the world of desire and the world, he is not contaminated, …. He has left, ….</p>

<p>“There is no bond for those who leave the tie”: For the practitioners of the holy path, where samatha is the forerunner, when the initial bond has been suppressed, when he reaches the state of Arahant, for the Arahant, knots, delusions, all kinds of covers, desires, malicious thoughts, harmful thoughts, and seeing thoughts are cut off, ….</p>

<p>“Whoever holds the thoughts and sees, they produce friction and walk in the world”: Whoever holds the thoughts: desires, malicious thoughts, and harmful thoughts, they create friction and mutual friction (with each other) because of their thoughts: the king and the king theory, khattiya and khattiya…, Brāhmaṇa and Brāhmaṇa, homeowner and homeowner, mother and son, son and mother, father and son, son and father, brothers and brothers, sisters and sisters, brothers and sisters, sisters and brothers, friends and friends.

<p>“Detached from thirst, before the disintegration”: Before the body disintegrates, before the self disintegrates, before the corpse is abandoned, before the root of life is cut off; the unthirsty, no longer thirsty, those who have given up their thirst, those who are rid of their cravings, those who have been liberated from thirst, those who have extinguished their thirst, those who have renounced their thirst; those who have renounced greed, those who have no greed, those who have eliminated greed, those who have been freed from greed, those who have given up greed; those who are not hungry, those who have been cooled, those who have become cool, those who feel happy, and those who live as Brāhmaṇa.</p>

<p>85 · Those who are not angry, those who are not afraid,<br />
Those who do not show off, those who do not regret,<br />
The speaker after consideration, the one who does not give up,<br />
He is indeed Muni with self-controlled speech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Those who are not angry, those who are not afraid”: Whoever is called “not angry,” anger should be spoken of first (This passage is unclear: ‘Akkodhanoti yañhi kho vuttaṃ. Api ca kodho tāva vattabbo.’). Anger is arisen in ten forms: “He has acted against me,” [AN.9.29] anger is aroused; “he is against my behavior,” anger is aroused; “he will act against me,” anger is aroused; “he has been unfavorable to my beloved and desirable behavior…, is unfavorable…, will be unfavorable,” anger is aroused; “he has benefited from what I do not love, undesirable…,” anger is arisen; or anger is arisen unjustified. Any kind of anger, hostility, hatred, aversion, evil, heart aversion, state of anger, aggression, brutal anger, rage, displeased heart, this is called anger.</p>
<p>In addition, the extreme and small states of anger should be perceived: sometimes anger is only the degree of turbidity, but not as much as frowning; sometimes anger is just as frowning, but not as much as gritted teeth; sometimes anger is just the degree of gritted teeth, but not as much as verbal abuse; sometimes anger is only to the level of verbal abuse, but not as much as looking around for a weapon; sometimes anger is just looking around in all directions (for a weapon), but not as much as the degree of (acquiring) the cane; sometimes the anger is only the degree of the cane, but not the degree of (pulling out) the cane; sometimes the anger is just the degree of the cane, but not as much as hitting with the cane; sometimes anger is just the hit of the cane, but not enough to fracture; sometimes anger is just fracturing and not enough to the degree of rupture; sometimes anger is only the degree of rupture, but not as much pulling apart every limb; sometimes anger is only the degree to which every limb is pulled apart, but not enough to kill; sometimes anger is just the taking away of life, but not as much as the degree of abandoning himself. When the angry person kills himself after killing others, this situation is that the anger further reaches the increase, and the further reaches the increase. For him for whom this anger is cut off, severed, calmed down, ceased, unable to arise, and burned by the fire of wisdom, he is called the unangered. The state of having given up on anger is regarded as not angry; the state of knowledge about anger is regarded as not angry; the state of being cut off from anger is regarded as not angry.</p>
<p>“Those who are not afraid,” here, one type of person is one who is afraid, those who have fear, and those who have terror. They tremble, have fear, terror, and come to fear: “I can’t get a home, or I can’t get a group (of people), or I can’t get shelter, or I can’t get profit, or I can’t get reputation, or I can’t get praise, or I can’t get pleasure, or I can’t get clothes, or I get a group meal, or I cannot get a bed seat, or I cannot get the patient’s necessities and medical necessities, or I cannot get care, or I am not known.” He was trembling, horrified, afraid, and fearful.</p>
<p>Here, the Bhikkhu is the one who is not afraid, has no terror, and fearless. He does not tremble, have fear, or come to fear: “I can’t get a home, ….” He does not tremble, …, or come to fear.</p>
<p>“Those who do not show off, those who do not regret”: Here, one type of person is boasting and showing off: I am a “sufficient person,” or a “person of precepts,” or a “person of prohibitions,” or “by birth, or by surname, or by good family, or by appearance and beauty like a lotus, or by property, …(omitted, see previous sections),” he boasted and showed off. He doesn’t boast or show off like this. From boasting and showing off, there is separation, abstaining, renunciation, he lives with an unrestrained heart.</p>
<p>“Those who do not regret,” “Regret,” the improper behavior of the hands is regret, the improper behavior of the feet is also regret, the improper behavior of the hands and feet is also regret, the inappropriate thought of as appropriate, the appropriate thought of as inappropriate, the untimely thought of as timely, the timely thought of as untimely, what is innocent is thought of as sin, what is sinful is thought of as innocent, all regret like this, the path of regret, the state of regret, the regret of the heart, the confusion of the mind, this is called regret.</p>
<p>In addition, regret, heart regret, and confusion of mind arise from two factors: what is done and what is not done …(omitted, see previous sections). He has regrets, heart regrets, and confusion of mind. This is what has been done and what has not been done, and regrets, heart regrets, and confusion of mind arise.</p>
<p>Or, “I am not a full-fledged person in the precepts….” For him for whom regrets have been cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, and burned by the fire of wisdom, he is called the one who does not regret.</p>
<p>“The speaker after consideration, the one who does not give up”: After consideration, it is called wisdom, which is wisdom, …(omitted). When there are many talks; wen there is a lot of explanation; when there is a lot of talk, he considers, explores, and then speaks. He does not say what is said by evil. “Those who do not fall away,” where, what is falling away? Wherever the heart is falling away, there is no silence; the heart is scattered; the heart is confused, which is called falling away. For him for whom this has been cut off….</p>
<p>“He is indeed a Muni who has self-controlled speech”: Here, after the bhikkhu abandons his words, he is a not a liar, truthful, true, reliable, trustworthy, and non-deceitful to the world. After discarding speaking, he is a distant speaker: hearing from here, he does not speak there to divide people, these people, like this, he is the mediator of division, the disseminator of harmony, the one who is willing to reconcile, the one who likes to reconcile, and the speaker of reconciliation. After abandoning the rough and evil words, he is the one who leaves the rough and evil words; the soft, pleasant, lovely and tempting, elegant, pleasant, and loved words by everyone, words like this are said by him. After cutting off the obscene language, he is the one who is free from the obscene language: he is the speaker at the right time, the speaker of the facts, the speaker of the benefit, the speaker of the Dhamma; he is the speaker of value at the right time, reasonable, restrained, and profitable words [AN.4.198]. He has four kinds of good deeds and four kinds of faultless words. He has been separated from the thirty-two beastly words, has renounced, has given up, has departed, has been freed, has given up his bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.</p>
<p>He speaks about ten things, namely: the theory of less desire, the theory of contentment…, the theory of living alone…, the theory of noncommunicating…, the theory of vitality…, the theory of commandment…, the conclusion…, the theory of wisdom…, the theory of liberation…, the theory of liberation wisdom…, mindfulness theory…, right diligence theory…, divine bases theory…, root theory…, power theory…, enlightenment theory…, Path theory…, Fruit theory, and Nibbāna theory. “Words with self-control” are cautious, prudent, guarded, protected, and silent. “Muni,” ….</p>

<p>86 · There is no bondage in the future,<br />
He does not lament the past,<br />
He sees touch (as) far away,<br />
And he is not guided in seeing (views).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“A person who has no bonds in the future”: Attachment is called craving, which is greed, …. For him, those who (do not) have this attachment, their cravings cut off, …, are those who are unbound in the future. In addition, “I will have such a form in my future life.” …(omitted). Because of the lack of hope of the heart, one doesn’t like it; when you don’t like it, this is also the unbounded actor in the future. “My ears will be like that in the future, and my voice will be like that.”…. In addition, “I will become (into) the heaven or one of the heavens with this virtue, prohibition, asceticism, and Brahma.” He does not hope for what is not obtained, and because of the lack of hope of the heart, he does not like it.</p>
<p>“He does not lament the past”: He does not grieve for what has changed, or is not sad for what is changing: “My eyes have changed,” he is not sad; my ears …. He is not sad, not tired, not weeping, not crying, not coming into confusion.</p>
<p>“Seeing touch as far away”: eye contact, ear contact, nose contact, tongue contact, body contact, intention contact, name contact, opposite contact [DN.15], a touch that should feel happy, a touch that should feel bitter, a touch that should feel neither suffering nor happiness, good touch, unwholesome touch, non-remembering touch, desire touch, physical touch, formless touch, empty touch, non-contact, unwilling touch, world touch, out of the world touch, the past, the future, the present, and the state of touch, contact, complete contact, and the state of complete contact like this is called touch.</p>
<p>“Seeing touch as far away”: With “me”, or with “what I have,” or with constancy, or with eternity, or with unchanging methods, he sees eye contact as far away; …, he sees ear contact as far away;. …(omitted) as far away from “I,” or “what I am,” or “forever,” or “everlasting,” or “unchanging.”</p>
<p>Or, he sees the past being touched by the future and the present; he sees the future being touched by the past and the present; he sees the present being touched by the past and the future, or, where those holy, no worries, out of the world, and void-related touch, the touch of greed he sees as far away; anger…, ignorance…, (omitted).</p>
<p>“He is not guided in seeing”: For him, the sixty-two evil views have been cut off, …, and he will not be carried away by seeing, taken away, carried, nor return to that evil view as the core.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>87 · Those who have withdrawn, not scheming,<br />
Not eager, not stingy,<br />
Those who are not arrogant, not (morally) disgusting,<br />
Not keen on (divisive) discourse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Withdrawn, non-scheming”: “Withdrawn,” The state of abandoning greed is withdrawal, …aversion…, …ignorance…, …anger… (omitted). This was said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus! How are the bhikkhus withdrawn? Bhikkhus! Here, the conceit of the bhikkhus’ self-being has been cut off, and the roots have been cut off, like a palm tree without roots, becoming a non-existent thing for the future, Bhikkhus! The Bhikkhu is withdrawn like this. [AN.4.38]”</p>
<p>“Non-scheming,” there are three kinds of scheming: scheming to use resources, scheming of deportment, and scheming of talking all around for gain.</p>
<p>What is the trickery of using resources? Here, the homeowners invite the bhikkhus with clothes, food, shelter, patients’ necessities, and medical necessities. He is a person with evil desire, a person with a desire for nature, and a person with hope. He is a person who has clothes, food, shelter, necessities of the patient, and medical necessities. Hoping for more and rejecting clothes, refusal to give food, refusal to shelter, refusal of patients’ necessities and medical necessities, he said: “What do high-value clothes have for a Samaṇa!” It is appropriate that a Samaṇa should use rags from the mound room or garbage dump or in front of the shop to make coats of. What does high-value food mean to a Samaṇa! It is appropriate that a Samaṇa should survive by wandering for alms. What is there for a Samaṇa with high-value accommodation! …A Samaṇa should be those who live under the trees or between the mounds or live in the open. …needs of patients and medical necessities! …should use medicine of fermented cow urine or crushed greens. After grasping that, he wears coarse clothes; receives coarse food; lives in coarse dwellings; uses coarse patients’ necessities and medical necessities. The homeowners knew him this way: “This Samaṇa is a person with little desire, a contented person, a lonely person, a person who is away from the masses, a person whose vitality has been activated, and a teacher.” They invite more and more with with clothes, food, shelter, patients’ necessities, and medical necessities. He said: “The three current states have faithful men who produce a lot of merit: the current state of faith has faithful men, the current state that produces a lot of merit and donation has a believing man who produces a lot of merit, and the current state of a person worthy of support has a believing man who produces a lot of merit. You are the believer, and the charity exists (is found), and I am the receiver. If I don’t accept it, then you will become outsiders of merit. This is not necessary for me, but just for pity, from you, I accept.” After clinging to that, he accepts many clothes, many foods, many residences, and many patients’ necessities and medical necessities. The frowning of anyone who frowns like this is the path of deceit, the state of deceit, this is deceit to gain resources.</p>
<p>What is the trickery of deportment? Here, there are certain types of evil desirers, those who desire nature, and those who desire respect, (thought): “In this way, people will respect me.” He placed to walk, placed to stand, placed to sit, placed to lie down, walked for desire, stood for desire, sat down for desire, lay down for desire, walked like a person in concentration, as in concentration he stands, sits down like a meditation person, lies down like a meditation person, and becomes visible as a meditator. The placement, strengthening, and complete placement of behaviors like this; the frown of this frowning person is the path of trickery and the state of trickery, this is the trickery of deportment.</p>
<p>What is the trickery of talking all around for gain?

<p>156 · The discerning person (with open eyes) tells<br />
Of the self-proven method of the adjustment of distress,<br />
Master! Please tell me about the Path,<br />
Pātimokkha, or even concentration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The discerning person speaks (of)”: “Narrative,” telling, explaining, teaching, informing, establishing, uncovering, analyzing, clarifying. “The eye,” The five eyes are the clear eyes: the naked eye is the clear eye, the heavenly eye is also the clear eye, the clear eye is also the clear eye, the Buddha’s eye is also the clear eye, and all eyes are also the clear eye.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the naked eye as “having eyes?” There are five colors in the eyes of the Blessed One: cyan, yellow, red, black, and white. The (Blessed One’s) eye hairs are blue, extremely blue, correct, beautiful, and equivalent to flax, and the others are yellow, extremely yellow, golden, and correct, beautiful, the equal of the flower of the bayur tree. The two eyes of the Blessed One are red, extremely red, straight, beautiful, red as the insects that come from the ground after the rain, and in the middle are black, extremely black, not coarse, smooth, straight, beautiful, and moist. The outers are white, extremely white, white, yellow-white, pleasing, beautiful, and equivalent to the Osadhī star. With the naked eyes of the Blessed One which belonged to him naturally having been born of previous good kamma, he sees everything in day and night, when there are four branches of darkness: sunset, moonless night, darkness of the heavy forest, the darkness of heavy clouds. Like this, when there is the darkness of the four branches, he also sees everything in day and night. There are no walls, or shutters, or fences, or mountains, or bushes, or groves, which are obstacles to his vision of form. If a sesame is marked and put into a cart full of sesame, he can select that sesame. In this way, the Blessed One’s natural naked eye is pure, and the Blessed One regards the naked eye as an eye.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the heavenly eye as “the one with eyes?” With a pure and transcendent celestial eye, the Blessed One sees that when all beings die and pass away, they are inferior, triumphant, beautiful, ugly, fortunate, and unfortunate, knowing that all beings flow according to their kamma: “These beings and monarchs have evil deeds of body, evil deeds of behavior, evil deeds of intention, rebuke the saints, wrong views and kamma of holding wrong views, they have passed away after death to the suffering realm, evil returning, lower realm, hell; or these beings, who have good deeds of body, good deeds of speech, good deeds of intentions, do not condemn the saints, and uphold the right view of the kamma, they have passed away to the world of goodness and heaven after death by disintegrating their bodies.” In this way, with a pure and transcendent celestial eye, he saw that when all beings died and passed away, in the inferiority, victory, beauty, ugliness, fortune, and misfortune, he knew the flow of all beings according to kamma. When he wants, the Blessed One can see one world, two worlds, three worlds, four worlds, five worlds, and ten worlds. Also, twenty world realms, thirty world realms, forty…, fifty…, one hundred, these thousand small worlds, two thousand middle world realms, as well as these three hundred thousand great world realms [AN.3.81]. If he wants to, he can see it. In this way, the Blessed One’s heavenly eyes are all pure, and the Blessed One regards the heavenly eyes as having eyes.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the wise eyes as the one with eyes? The Blessed One is the great wisdom, broad wisdom, quick wisdom, sharp wisdom, piercing wisdom, advising wisdom: those who are skillful, those who have developed wisdom, those who have proved that they have reached the unimpeded, those who have reached the four fearless ones, those who possess ten powers, those who are like bulls, those who are like lions, those who can have great wealth, those with boundless wisdom, those with boundless brilliance, those with boundless fame, the rich, the wealthy, the guide, the moderator, the comforter, the informer, the one who makes it seen, the one who makes it visible, the one who makes it clear, the Blessed One is indeed the founder of the unborn Path, the producer of the unborn Path, the unannounced preacher; the one who knows the Path, the knower of the Path, and, (his) disciples now live in the Path’s accompaniment, and will be the possessors in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One is indeed the knower and seer, who knows and sees; he is the one who is born with eyes, born with wisdom, born with Dhamma, and born with Brahma; he is an interpreter and promoter of righteousness, the immortal giver, Dhamma King, Tathāgata; there is nothing that the Blessed One did not know, did not see, did not testify (prove), did not touch with wisdom; the past, the future, and the present came to the Buddha and the Blessed One with all the deeds in the field of wisdom, anyone with any name that should be guided to reason can know: one’s own righteousness or others’ righteousness or both, or the righteousness of the current life or the righteousness of the next life or both, or deep or hidden, or should be guided to infer, or have been guided to determine, or no fault or pollution, or clear or supreme interest, everything revolves in the Buddha’s wisdom.</p>
<p>All body kamma is transferred in the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One; all language kamma…; all mental kamma…; the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One about the past is barrier-free; ..future…; …present…; all that should be guided to infer is the reach of wisdom; all wisdom is guided to be inferred, and all that should be guided to be inferred is the ultimate wisdom; the ultimate wisdom is what is guided to be deduced, and there is no wisdom beyond what is guided to be deduced; there is no way to transcend the wisdom that is guided and deduced. These dhammas live in mutual restriction, such as two boxes, where the covers are completely in contact; the lower cover does not go over the upper one, and the upper cover does not go over the lower one; restricted to each other. (Similarly, ) all that should be guided… (omitted); these dhammas live in mutual restriction.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred in all the Dhamma, all the Dhamma is the Buddha, the Blessed One’s turning belongs, the hope belongs, the intention belongs, the mind arises, the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred to all living beings, the Blessed One knows the intentions of all living beings, knows the potential tendency of troubles, …the behavior, …solution, about the less dusty, the more dusty; the rooted, the dull rooted, the good deeds, the evil deeds, and the teachability and unteachability of beings; capable and incapable sentient beings, including the world of heaven, demons, and Brāhmaṇa; generations of Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven, and man all revolve in the wisdom of Buddha.</p>
<p>If any fish, turtles, and even the big fish swallowing boats revolve in the sea, the same, including the world of heaven, the world of demons, and the world of Brāhmaṇa; the generations including Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven and man are all turned around in the Buddha wisdom, such as any bird and even the gold-winged birds were turning around in the field of space. In the same way, those who possess the same wisdom as Sāriputta also revolve in the field of Buddha wisdom. The wisdom of the Buddha is pervasive and transcends heaven and human.</p>
<p>Those wise khattiya, wise Brāhmaṇas, wise homeowners, wise Samaṇas, smart dissidents, sharp breakers who want to act on evil views with a wise attitude, they prepare problems to be seen later; they saw the Tathāgata and asked about the what is hidden and secret. Those questions were discussed and answered by the Blessed One with reasons, and they abandoned those (others) nearby and became the (disciples) of the Blessed One. At that time, the Blessed One was there, shining with wisdom. In this way, the Blessed One regards the insight as an eye.</p>
<p>How is it that the Buddha’s eyes are “the one who as eyes?” When the Blessed One observes the world with the eyes of the Buddha, he sees those with less dust and more dust; those with roots and blunt roots; …good deeds and evil deeds; …easy to teach and difficult to teach; the existing sins and terrors of the other worlds, others who do not live in seeing sin and terror in other worlds. Just like in the green lotus pond, red lotus pond, and white lotus pond, some green lotus, red lotus, and white lotus grow in the water, rest on the surface of the water, sink and grow underwater; some …are born in the water and grow in the water, and live on the same height (as the surface); some …rise above the water and live and dwell without being stained by water. Similarly, when the Blessed One observes the world with the eyes of the Buddha, he sees those with less dust and more dust; … [DN.14]. The Blessed One knows: “This person is a greedy person, this person is an abusive person, this person is a foolish person, this person is a pathfinder, this person is a believer, and this person is a wise person.” The Blessed One speaks to the greedy people, the Blessed One informs those who hate walkers of the practice of compassion, the Blessed One makes them settled in recitation, questioning, hearing of the Dhamma at the right time, discussion of the Dhamma at the right time, and co-living with teachers. The Blessed One informs the person who seeks the path, the Blessed One tells those who believe in confidence: the good sense of Buddha, the good nature of the Dhamma, the good practice of the Saṅgha and his precepts. The Blessed One teaches vipassanā to those who are wise practitioners: impermanence, suffering, and non-self.</p>

<p>How does the Blessed One regard all eyes as having eyes? All eyes are called the state all knowing wisdom. The Blessed One arrives (has), fully arrives (has), enters, fully enters, has enough, has all the state wisdom of knowing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“Do not become unstable with your eyes”: What is a person with unstable eyes? Here, there is a category of people who have eye restlessness: “Those that should be seen become unseen, and those that should be unseen become seen.” From gardens to gardens, from villages to villages, from towns to towns, from cities to cities, from countries to countries, from localities to localities, he did so (wandered) in order to see long and irregular parades (processions). Those who engage in this, such are those with restless eyes.</p>
<p>Or, when the bhikkhu is a visitor at home, a walker on the street, he walks unprotected: he looks at the elephant, the horse, the cart, the infantry, the boy, and the girl as he walks. Watching women, watching men, watching the market, watching the door of the house, watching the top, watching the bottom, and watching in all directions, this is also restless.</p>
<p>Or, after the bhikkhu sees a form with his eyes, he becomes a grasper of appearance and a grasper of subtle appearance, because when he stays at the root of his eyes, greed, sorrow and evil will flow in. He does not act according to his self-control, does not protect the roots of the eyes, and does not achieve self-control [SN.35.120] of the roots of the eyes.</p>
<p>Or if some Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇa masters received food offered by faith, they dwelt at performances and watched like this: dancing, singing, music, drama, speaking about ancient times, handbells, cymbals, drums, magic, iron balls, bamboo stick play, stunts, elephant fighting, horse fighting, buffalo fighting, bull fighting, goat fighting, ram fighting, rooster fighting, quail fighting, club fighting, fist fighting, wrestling, exercises, drills, army formations, military parade [DN.1], etc., who are engaged in watching various performances like this, which is also restlessness.</p>
<p>How can you not be a restless person? Here, when the bhikkhu is a visitor to his home and a walker in the street, he walks in a protective manner: he does not look at the elephant, the horse, …. This is not a restless person.</p>

<p>“To alone get joy”: “Alone,” the Blessed One is alone having become a bhikkhu, the righteousness without a partner is the alone, the righteousness of the thirst for love is alone, the “always away from greed” is alone, “always away from anger” is alone, “always away form the heart” means alone, “always no pollution” means alone, “has crossed the road without forks” means alone, and “has already realized single enlightenment” means alone.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone having become a bhikkhu? When the Blessed One was young, the black-haired youth possessed the happiness of youth. At the beginning of life, even if the parents didn’t want, tearful, crying, and sighing, they still abandon their relatives, cut off all obstacles in the home, and cut off the barrier of their children and wife, …family, …friend, …storage, shave hair and put on robes, go out from home, being a bhikkhu in a non-domestic life, into a state of no possessions, then walk alone, live, act, go on, guard, and survive.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone without a partner? When he was such a bhikkhu, he was alone in the woods, wild forests, and border dwellings (sitting places): quiet, away from the atmosphere, living alone, suitable for sitting alone; he would walk alone, stand alone, sit alone, lie alone, enter the village alone for alms, go forward alone, return alone, sit alone in a quiet place, perform alone, live, move, go on, guard, and survive alone.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone with the disruption of thirsting love? He is so alone and without a partner, when he lived in reluctance, zealous, and self-effort. Under the Bodhi tree by the Nerañjarā River, with diligence and effort, destroying the devil (Māra) accompanied by the army, the evil demon, and the relatives of the relaxed; afterwards, the netted, strong flowing, entangled thirsty loves, he abandoned, drove away, ended, and made to go to no-existence.</p>
<p>“People who have thirsty love as their partner,<br />
Reincarnate for a long time,<br />
Become such a state, other states,<br />
Do not go beyond reincarnation.<br />
Knowing this kind of trouble:<br />
Craving is the origin of suffering,<br />
Departing from thirsty love, without taking,<br />
Bhikkhus should march mindfully.”<br />
[It.15/Sn.3.12,745-746]</p>
<p>How can the Blessed One be alone with “always away from greed?” The state of renouncing greed is aloneness, the state of renouncing anger is aloneness, the state of renouncing delusion is aloneness, the state of announcing pollution is aloneness.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One one who “has passed the road without a fork” as alone? The road without forks is called the Four Mindfulness… (omitted) Eight Sacred Paths.</p>
<p>“The one who sees the death of life (rebirth), the compassionate one,<br />
Who knows the way without forks,<br />
Using this way, they crossed torrents in the past,<br />
Will cross (in the future), and are (crossing) in the present.”<br />
[SN.47.18]</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One’s “Single Enlightenment” being alone? Enlightenment is called wisdom, root of wisdom, power of wisdom, enlightenment of choice, investigation, vipassanā, right view on the four realms. The Blessed One realized that “all actions are impermanent,” …“every collection of dhammas is extinguished.” Or, everything that should be felt, should be conscious, should be awakened, should be enlightened, should be realized, should be touched, should be testified, everything is conscious of that consciousness, awakening, enlightenment, attainment, reaching, testifying.</p>
<p>“To gain joy,” “Joy,” the joy of abstinence, the joy of separation, the joy of silence, the joy of enlightenment, he gains, arrives, attains, reaches, and testifies.</p>

<p>192 · The one who is enlightened, the one who does not depend,<br />
The one like that, the one who does not trick,<br />
I have come to the Blessed One,<br />
With a question from those in need<br />
From the many bound people here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The one who is enlightened, the one who does not depend on, the one like that”: “The enlightened one,” that is the one who is the world-honored person, the one who is alone, and the one without a teacher who is now enlightened by the Dhamma that has not been heard before. The truth is there to reach all states of knowing, to reach the state of freedom in power. “Enlightened one,” what is the meaning of enlightened one? “The one who feels the truth” is the enlightened one, the “makes the living being aware”…, the state of all knowing…, the state of all seeing, and the state that is not guided by others is the enlightened. Those who have flowed out are the enlightened ones, those who have exhausted their troubles are given names as enlightened ones, those who have no troubles…, those who have always been free from greed are enlightened, and those who have always been free from hatred. For the enlightened person, “the one who has always been away from ignorance” is the enlightened person, “the one who has always been free from pollution”…, the one who has crossed the road without crossroads…, and the one who has been alone-enlightened without being taught. For the enlightened person, the state of not being killed is the enlightened person, and the state of being enlightened is the enlightened person. “Enlightened person,” this name is not given (made) by the mother, not given by the father, not …by the brothers, …sisters, …friends, relatives; Samaṇas or Brāhmaṇas; not given my heaven, this is ultimate liberation; the establishment (pseudonym) of the acquisition and testimony of the Buddha, the Blessed One, and the Bodhi tree, together with all knowledge and wisdom, is the enlightened one.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of dependence for the “non-dependent”: the dependence of craving and the dependence of seeing. What is the dependence of craving? All are called boundaries (, as realm), as a range, as a boundary, to be grasped, to be regarded as one’s own: this is mine, this is mine, so much of it is mine, and this range is mine; my form, sound, smell, taste, touch, things on the ground, coats, maids and male servants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows and horses, mules, fields, homesteads, gold, gold coins, villages, towns, capitals, places, treasuries, warehouses, all the land, because they are thirsty and regard them as their own, all one-hundred-and-eight thirsty trends [AN.4.199], this is dependence on craving.</p>
<p>What is the refusal to see (views)? There are twenty views of the body, ten evil views, ten side views, all views like this, evil views, jungle (entangled) views, desert (barren) views, distorted views, shaken views; the clinging, acceptance, holding, grasping to the bound view, the place where the evil way, the evil nature, the outside way depend, the clasping of the inversion (vipariyesa), the clinging of the inversion (viparīta), the inversion (vipallāsa), the grip of the evil, the clasping of evil, the grip of “(seeing) the real in the unreal,” all come to the reach of the sixty-two evil views, which is the refusal to see.</p>
<p>For the Buddha and the Blessed One, the dependence of craving has been cut off, the dependence of seeing has been cut off, …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“Those like that,” the Blessed One is like that from five aspects: those who are satisfied or unsatisfied are like that, those who have been abandoned are like that, those who have passed through are like that, the “liberated” are those who are like that.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One to be like that, whether satisfied or dissatisfied? The Blessed One is like that in getting; like that in not getting; like that in (having) reputation; like that in (not having) reputation; …in praise and rebuke…; in joy and suffering. Some people use spice on their wrists, and some people use axes to work: he has no greed in being like that; he has no disgust in being like that, he has given up greed and dislike, has overcome victory and defeat, has passed obedience and opposition.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One’s “forsaken” as such? The Blessed One’s greed has been abandoned, spit out, released, cut off, and dismissed; …anger…, ignorance, resentment, hiding evil, domineering, stinginess, hypocrisy, cunning, stubbornness passion, conceit, arrogance, sloth, slacking, all pollution, all evils, all afflictions, all scorching heat (torment), all irritation, all bad work has been abandoned, spit out, released, renounced, and dismissed.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One’s “passed over” as such? The violent currents of the worldly desire have been passed; torrents of being have been passed; the torrents of seeing have been passed; the violent currents of ignorance have been passed; all the circuits have been passed, have come out, have crossed, have overcome, he is the one who has descended, the person who has practiced, the person who has completed the journey, the person who has reached the direction, the person who has reached the end, the person who has guarded the Brahma, the person who has reached the highest view, the person who has practiced the Path, the person who has cut off the pollution, the unshakable person, the person who has testified to extermination, for him, the suffering has been known, the congregation has been abandoned, the Path has been practiced, the extinction has been testified, the one who has been proved to be known, the knowing can be known, those who have renounced what should be renounced, those who have been practiced what should be practiced, and those who have testified what should be testified. He is the one whose obstacle has been removed, the one whose ditch has been filled, the one whose pillar has been pulled up, the one who has no latch, the one whose holy flag has fallen, the one whose burden has been removed, the one who has separated, the one whose five branches have been cut off, and the one who has six branches. Those who have one guardian and four reliances are those whose truths have been removed, those who seek to have renounced and completely decayed, those who have no turbid intentions, those who have calmed their lives, those who are kind and free, those who are freed by wisdom; the highest person, the supreme person, who has achieved the supreme accomplishment, neither composes nor disassembles, does not accumulate and then stands; neither gives up nor clings, but stands after giving up; neither dispelling nor accumulating, staying standing after dispelling; neither extinguishing nor burning, staying standing after extinguishing [SN.22.79], a person who has the state of no learning precepts, and a state of no learning dwelling, the dweller who has the state of wisdom without learning, the dweller with the state of ignorance of the abundance of knowledge, the dweller who has the state of emancipation of no learning, the state of wisdom, and the abiding after completion and penetration of the truth, those who have passed the disturbance (craving), those who stand after the pollution fire is extinguished, those who are no longer coming at all, those who have grasped (victory), those who are free from using, the pure dweller of compassion, the pure dweller of mercy, the pure dweller of joy, the pure dweller of peace, the pure dweller of all, the state of of equality, pervasively pure dwellers, those who have been liberated, those who have been fulfilled, those who are in the ultimate (boundary), those who are in the world, and those who are the dweller at the ultimate, the dweller at the ultimate place of coming around, the dweller at the ultimate rebirth, the dweller at the ultimate end of life (, the dweller at the end of existence, the dweller at the end of reincarnation, the dweller of the last body, the dweller of the ultimate cycle, the dweller of the ultimate walking, the dweller of the supreme at the end), the dweller of the last gathering (body), the deity who holds the last body.</p>

The one who is enlightened, the one who does not depend, the one like that.</p>
<p>“Non-tricking, those who come to the Blessed One”: “Non-tricking,” three kinds of trickery: …(omitted, see previous sections). For the Buddha and the Blessed One, these three kinds of tricks: tricks to use resources, tricks of deportment, and tricks of talking all around for gain have been cut off, severed, calmed down, stopped, unable to arise, and burned by the fire of wisdom, so the Buddha is non-tricking.</p>

<p>What is the limit of abstinence? Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who lives and is protected by the self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient righteousness and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns after accepting from a teacher. When examining the state of internal decay, he practiced the internal precepts of self-control, not breaking the boundaries. This is the precept of self-control.</p>
<p>What is the limit of self-control? Here, after the bhikkhu sees the form with his eyes, he does not become a grasper of the aspect, a grasper of the subtle aspect… (omitted) he achieves self-control at the base of his eyes. After hearing the sound with ears…, smelling with the nose…, after tasting with the tongue…, after touching with the body…, after knowing the Dhamma with consciousness, …., because the when the root of mind is not protected, greed, sorrow and evil will flow in. He acts according to his self-control, protects the root of mind, and achieves self-control on the root of mind. When examining the burning method, he practices internal self-control boundaries and does not break the boundaries. This is the root self-control boundary.</p>
<p>What is the dietary knowledge limit? Here, the bhikkhu eats food after inspection: “Neither for pleasure, nor for intoxication, not for a good figure, not for dignity, but for the existence and survival of this body, to stop harm, and to support the Brahma. In this way, I will repel the previous feelings, not arouse new feelings, be healthy, without fault, and live in peace.” When examining the oiling of the axles, the coverage of sores [SN.35.239], and the analogy of the son’s meat [SN.12.63], he practiced the internal boundary to know the right amount, not breaking the boundaries, this is the limit of knowing the right amount of of diet as self-control.</p>
<p>What is the limit of specializing in sobriety? Here, during the day, the bhikkhu cleanses the mind from obstacles by walking and sitting peacefully. During the first (watch of the) night, by walking and sitting peacefully, the mind should be purified from obstacles. In the middle of the night, lying on the right side as a lion, put the (left) foot on the (right) foot, with mindfulness and righteous knowledge, contemplating. In the latter night, by walking and sitting still, the mind should be purified from obstacles [SN.35.120].

<div class="page-break"></div>
<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>From the delightful city of Kosala,<br />
On the south road,<br />
Desiring to have nothingness,<br />
Went a Brāhmaṇa who knows the Vedas.</p></li>
<li><p>In the realm of Assaka,<br />
In Alạka between the two countries,<br />
On the banks of the Godhāvarī River<br />
He lived begging and picking fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>Near where he sheltered,<br />
There was a large village,<br />
The income from which he used<br />
To hold a great sacrifice.</p></li>
<li><p>He returned to his thatched house<br />
After the sacrifice,<br />
And when he entered again,<br />
Another Brāhmaṇa came.</p></li>
<li><p>With worn feet, thirsty,<br />
Dirty teeth, dusty head,<br />
He (the latter) went to see him (the former),<br />
Begging for five hundred (units of money).</p></li>
<li><p>When Bāvari (the former) saw him,<br />
He invited him to sit down,<br />
Asked if he was well and peaceful, and said:</p></li>
<li><p>What wealth I had,<br />
I have given it all away,<br />
Pardon me, Brāhmaṇa,<br />
I do not have five hundred.</p></li>
<li><p>(The latter:) If you will not give it<br />
To me who asks,<br />
On the seventh day,<br />
May your head split into seven pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>After the imposter contrived (with the usual niceties),<br />
He declared this terrible curse;<br />
After he heard these words,<br />
Bāvari became anguished.</p></li>
<li><p>He became thin from lack of eating,<br />
Like one pierced by an arrow;<br />
Those who have such hearts,<br />
Their minds are not happy in meditation.</p></li>
<li><p>Seeing him so afflicted,<br />
A deity who wanted to benefit (him),<br />
Came to see Bāvari and said:</p></li>
<li><p>This imposter who asks for money<br />
Does not know about the head,<br />
Nor about head-splitting,<br />
This is not known by him.</p></li>
<li><p>(Bāvari:) If that is the case,<br />
If you know, please tell me when asked,<br />
About the head and head-splitting,<br />
Let me hear your words.</p></li>
<li><p>(Deity:) Neither do I know this,<br />
It is not known by my wisdom,<br />
Only the conquerors know about head-splitting.</p></li>
<li><p>(Bāvari:) If that is the case,<br />
Then who on this earth knows,<br />
About the head and head-splitting:<br />
Please tell me about him!</p></li>
<li><p>(Deity:) Formerly a bhikkhu from Kapilavatthu,<br />
The teacher of the world,<br />
Descendant of the Okkāka king, son of the Sakyas,<br />
He who brings light;</p></li>
<li><p>His Dhamma has reached the other side,<br />
Gone beyond all doctrines,<br />
A Brāhmaṇa Buddha with great wisdom and power,<br />
Knowledge of all dhammas, freed from corruption,<br />
The liberated one who is extinct in adherence.</p></li>
<li><p>He is the Buddha, respected by the world,<br />
Who teaches the Dhamma to the world,<br />
Come to him and ask,<br />
He will explain to you.</p></li>
<li><p>After hearing the words “Enlightened One,”<br />
Bāvari was pleased.<br />
His sorrow was lessened,<br />
His joy was great.</p></li>
<li><p>Happy, enthusiastic, and joyful,<br />
Bāvari asked the deity:<br />
In which village or town or place,<br />
Can we see after going there,<br />
The enlightened person, the highest biped?</p></li>
<li><p>(Deity:) In the land of Kosala, in Sāvatthī,<br />
Is the conqueror, the wise man,<br />
The Sakyamuni, who is incomparable,<br />
Trouble-free, the unattached, bull of men.</p></li>
<li><p>Then the Brāhmaṇa summoned his disciples,<br />
Brāhmaṇas who knew the Vedas:<br />
Students! Come! I will speak to you,<br />
Please listen to my words.</p></li>
<li><p>One rare to see,<br />
Now he arises in the world;<br />
He is known as the Enlightened One,<br />
Make haste to Sāvatthī to see this greatest of bipeds.</p></li>
<li><p>(Students:) And how will we know, Brāhmaṇa, the Buddha?<br />
Tell those of us who do not know,<br />
How we can know him.</p></li>
<li><p>(Bāvari:) He was described in the Vedas,<br />
Thirty-two marks are fully described in order.</p></li>
<li><p>For those who have these on their body,<br />
These features of a great man,<br />
There are two ways,<br />
A third cannot be found.</p></li>
<li><p>If he lives at home,<br />
After conquering this land,<br />
With no rod and no sword,<br />
He rules with justice.</p></li>
<li><p>But if he becomes a homeless person,<br />
He becomes the one who lifts the veil,<br />
The enlightened one,<br />
And the supreme Arahant.</p></li>
<li><p>(About my) lineage, surname, characteristics,<br />
Vedas, disciples, and further,<br />
About the head and head-splitting:<br />
Please ask (him) only in your mind.</p></li>
<li><p>If he is the Buddha,<br />
The unobstructed seer,<br />
When you ask with your mind,<br />
He will answer in words.</p></li>
<li><p>After hearing Bāvari’s words,<br />
Sixteen Brāhmaṇa disciples:<br />
Ajita, Tissa Metteyya,<br />
Punṇạka, and Mettagū,</p></li>
<li><p>As well as Dhotaka and Upasīva,<br />
Nanda and Hemaka,<br />
The two Todeyya and Kappa,<br />
And the wise Jatukanṇị̄,</p></li>
<li><p>As well as Bhadrāvudha and Udaya,<br />
And the Brāhmaṇa Posāla,<br />
The clever Mogharāja,<br />
And the great rishi Piṅgiya;</p></li>
<li><p>All having disciples or followers,<br />
Famous people in the world,<br />
Meditators, jhāna-loving,<br />
Sturdy in past practice;</p></li>
<li><p>After asking Bāvari, they rose,<br />
Circled him to the right,<br />
Put on their sheepskins,<br />
And left to the north.</p></li>
<li><p>Patitṭḥāna of Alạka first,<br />
Then to Māhissatī,<br />
To Ujjenī and Gonaddhā,<br />
Vedisā, and Vanasa,</p></li>
<li><p>Also to Kosambī and Sāketa,<br />
And the highest city Sāvatthī,<br />
Setavya, Kapilavatthu,<br />
And the city of Kusinārā,</p></li>
<li><p>Pāvā and Bhoga city,<br />
Vesālī, Māgadhan city,<br />
And Pāsānạka Cetiya (Rock Temple),<br />
Pleasant and charming.</p></li>
<li><p>As cool water is to a thirsty person,<br />
As a great profit is to a merchant,<br />
Like the shade of the sun to those oppressed by heat,<br />
They hurried up the mountain.</p></li>
<li><p>At that time, the Blessed One was arranged<br />
In front of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha,<br />
Teaching the Dhamma,<br />
Like a lion roaring in the forest.</p></li>
<li><p>Ajita saw the Buddha:<br />
Like the sun woven by light,<br />
Like the moon on the fifteenth day<br />
Reaching its fullness.</p></li>
<li><p>Having seen the Buddha<br />
And his complete features,<br />
He (Ajita) stood to the side<br />
And asked questions in his mind:</p></li>
<li><p>Please tell us about the birth of our teacher,<br />
Please tell us his surname and characteristics,<br />
Please tell me about his perfection in the Vedas,<br />
(And) how many (students) does the Brāhmaṇa teach?</p></li>
<li><p>(The Blessed One:) His age is one hundred and twenty years,<br />
His surname is Bāvari,<br />
He has three characteristics on his body,<br />
And he is one who knows the Three Vedas.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of characteristics and ancient legends,<br />
Including vocabulary and rituals,<br />
He teaches five hundred (students),<br />
And he has achieved perfection in his (own) teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>(Ajita, non-verbally:) Blessed One,<br />
Whose thirst is quenched,<br />
Tell us of Bāvari’s characteristics<br />
So that we can have no doubts.</p></li>
<li><p>(The Blessed One:) He can cover his face with his tongue,<br />
He has a white tuft of hair between the eyebrows,<br />
His male organ is sheathed,<br />
Know this, student.</p></li>
<li><p>Having heard answers<br />
Without having heard the questions,<br />
(Religious) joy arose in the Saṅgha,<br />
And, hands together, they thought:</p></li>
<li><p>Which deva or Brahmā,<br />
Or even Indā, the husband of Sujā,<br />
Who asks these questions in the mind?<br />
Whom does he answer?</p></li>
<li><p>(Ajita, verbally): Bāvari asked about the head and head-splitting,<br />
Please answer, Blessed One,<br />
For the removal of our doubts, great rishi!</p></li>
<li><p>(The Blessed One:) Ignorance is the “head,”<br />
Knowledge is the “head-splitting,”<br />
When combined with faith, mindfulness,<br />
Concentration, desire, and vitality.</p></li>
<li><p>The student Brāhmaṇa,<br />
Strengthened with religious feelings,<br />
Arranged his hide over one shoulder<br />
And fell with his head to (The Blessed One’s) feet.</p></li>
<li><p>(Ajita:) Master Bāvari, the Brāhmaṇa,<br />
Together with his disciples,<br />
Happy, and respectful,<br />
We bow to your feet, One who sees clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>(The Blessed One:) May Bāvari the Brāhmaṇa by happy,<br />
Together with his students;<br />
May you too be happy<br />
And live long, student!</p></li>
<li><p>Bāvari’s doubts or yours,<br />
The doubts of all,<br />
Have been permitted (to be asked),<br />
Please ask whatever you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Having the permission of the Enlightened One,<br />
They sat down and pressed their palms together, And Ajita asked his first question of the Tathāgata.</p></li>

[SN.12.31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Those know know the Dhamma”: Those who perceive the Dhamma are called Arahants, those who have exhausted their troubles. For what reason is the enlightened person called an Arahant, a person who has exhausted his troubles? They are the perceivers of the Dhamma, the knowers of the Dhamma, the measurers of the Dhamma, the judges of the Dhamma, the clear ones. “All actions are impermanent,” the perceiver of the Dhamma, the knower of the Dhamma, the weigher of the Dhamma, the judge of the Dhamma; “all actions are suffering”…, “all action is no-self”…, “action is based on ignorance”…, “all dhammas are extinguished”…. Or, to them, it is the enlightened person of the aggregate, the enlightened person of the realm, the enlightened person of the place, the enlightened person of coming-around, the enlightened person of rebirth, the perceiver of reincarnation. Or, they are the inhabitants of the ultimate (boundary), the ultimate in the world, the ultimate in the place, the ultimate in the place of going around, the ultimate in the rebirth, those who live the ultimate, those who have the ultimate, those who are the ultimate in rebirth, those who are the ultimate in the cycle, the Arahant who holds the last body.</p>
<p>“(In the uncountable tribulations,<br />
They are the ones who gain the body,)<br />
This is their last, final body.<br />
The reincarnation of life and death,<br />
Without their rebirth.”<br />

<p>For this reason, the enlightened person is called an Arahant, a person who has exhausted his troubles. “Those who know the Dhamma, and everyone learning here”: “There is learning,” for what reason are they said to be learning? “They learn,” hence learning. And what do they learn? The learn to increase precepts, they learn to increase mind, and they also learn to increase wisdom.</p>
<p>What is meant by “to increase precepts?” Here, the bhikkhu is a preceptor who lives in the protection of self-control of the Pātimokkha. He has sufficient righteousness and state of affairs. He sees the horror in minor sins and learns after accepting from a teacher. Small precepts aggregate and large precept aggregates are the foundation of abstinence, the (self) inhibition of behavior, the entrance of self-control, the uppermost of good dhamma, etc., this is to increase precept learning.</p>
<p>What is meant by “to increase mind?” Here, the bhikkhu starts from the desire to escape… (omitted) the first jhāna…, the second jhāna…, the third jhāna…, after entering, he lives in the fourth jhāna (neither suffering or joyous, from calm and chanting), this is “to learn to increase mind.”</p>
<p>What is learning to increase wisdom? Here, the bhikkhu is a wise person, possessing the knowledge of arising and passing away; the holy, insight, and the complete extinction of suffering is (the wisdom), he truthfully knows “This is suffering. …(omitted)” “this is hard work.”… “this is the path that leads to suffering”… “these are troubles”… “this is the set of troubles”… “this is annoyance”… “this is the path leading to troubles;” this is the addition of wisdom. These three learnings, they learn when they face (note); they learn when they know; they learn when they see (; when they learn with introspection); they learn when the mind is established (in a decision); they learn when faith prevails; they learn with vigor and hard work; when mindfulness arises, they learn; when mind is set (focused) they learn; when wisdom is learned, they learn; when they are proved to have known, they learn; they learn through renunciation; they learn when they practice; they practice well, and sustain when they are testified, then they go on. For this reason they are called learning. “Everyone” is the multitude. These learned practitioners are the Sotāpanna, Sakadāgāmī, Anāgāmī, and Arahant. “Here,” in this view, in this liking, in this inclination, in this proposition, in this Dhamma, in this teaching, in this practice, in the teachings of this Master, in this individual, in this human world.</p>
<p>“When the wise are asked about their behavior, my dear sir! Please tell me”: You are the wise and enlightened, who knows the Dhamma and learned the behavior, conduct, practice, travel, residing, and path. “Are asked,” being questioned; begging, being inquired of; make it clear. “Please tell”: please explain, please teach, …. “Dear Sir,” ….</p>

<p>8 · (The Blessed One:) You should not be greedy in desire,<br />
And your mind should not be muddy,<br />
Being a skillful person of all dhammas,<br />
The bhikkhu should wander mindfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Should not be greedy in desire”: “Desire,” there are two kinds of desires: the desire for things and the desire for pollution. What are the desires for things? Desirable sight, sound, smell, taste, touch; bedding, clothing, maidservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, mules, horses, fields, houses, gold, gold coins, villages and towns, capitals, countries, territories, treasuries, warehouses; everything that can be tainted by greed is the desire for things.</p>
<p>In addition, there are past desires, future desires, present desires, internal desires, external desires, internal and external desires, inferior desires, medium desires, superior desires; desires in the suffering world, human desires, heavenly desires, existing desire, created desire, uncreated desire, created desire by others, possessed desire, unpossessed desire, cherished desire, non-cherished desires; the desires of all the worlds of desire, the desires of all the worlds of physicality, all the desires of the world of non-material worlds, dependence on thirst and desire for love, desiring righteousness, greed for righteousness, the desire to be intoxicated by righteousness and happiness, is called the desire for things.</p>
<p>What is the desire for defilement? The desire for desire, the desire for greed, the desire of desire to greed, the desire of intention, the desire for lust, the desire for intention, the joy of desire, love obsession, the binding harness of desire, attachment, the desire for cover.</p>
<p>“Seeing those roots of desire,<br />
Wanting to be produced by thought (intention),<br />
I will not think of them,<br />
So desire will not exist.”<br />
[Jat.8.421]</p>
<p>These are called polluting desires. Craving thirst, attachment, it is greed, lust… (omitted) unwholesome roots. “Should not be greedy in desire”: In the desire to pollute, one should not be greedy, or obstructed in the desire of things, should be separated from greed, and those who have excluded greed, have been freed from greed, have renounced greed, have no greed, have eliminated greed, those who have attained the cessation of greed, have no hunger and thirst, those who have extinguished, have become cool, and feel joy, should live as a Brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p>“Mind should not be muddy”: “Mind”: all the heart, mind, heart, white (clean), meaning, intentions, consciousness, corresponding to that consciousness. With evil acts of the body, the mind becomes turbid, agitated, moving, impacting, volatile, fluctuating, rotating, and restless; acting evil with words… (omitted), acting evil with intention…, with greed…, aversion…, with ignorance…, with anger…, with resentment…, in hiding evil…, with domineering…, with jealousy…, with stinginess…, with hypocrisy…, with cunning…, with stubbornness…, with passion…, with conceit…, with arrogance…, with relaxation…, with all pollution…, with all evil deeds…, with all troubles…, with all the heat (of suffering)…; the unwholesome mind, turbid, agitated, volatile, fluctuating, rotating, and restless. “The mind should not be muddy”: The mind should not be cloudy: not disturbed, not shaken, not moved, not rotated, calmed down, and all pollution should be abandoned, should be discarded, should be driven away, should be ended, should be made to cease to exist; one should be separated from muddiness and pollution, quashed, abstained, separated, left, liberated; free from bondage, one should live with an unrestrained heart.</p>
<p>“This is a skillful person of all the Dhamma”: “All actions are impermanent”, the skillful one in the Dhamma knows; “all actions are suffering”…, “all actions are without self”…, “ignorance is the cause of all deeds”….</p>
<p>Or (seeing as) impermanent, the skillful person in all dhammas; it is suffering… (omitted), it is disease…, it is the tumor…, it is the arrow… the curse…, the other side…, corruption…, disaster…, movable…, perishable…, unstable…, it is no refuge…, is miserable…, the root of misfortune…, hypocritical…, empty…, selfless…, it is the dhamma of impermanence…, the murderer…, increasing…, bait…, is life…, the method of old age…, the method of sorrow and despair…, of pollution…, pleasure…, the extinction…, the trouble…, a good man who renounces for the skillfulness of all dhammas.</p>
<p>Or, the person skillful with the aggregates, …of the would, …of the place, …with dependent origination, of mindfulness, righteousness, the divine bases, …of the root, of power, of consciousness, of support, of the Path, of the Fruit, of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Or, all dhamma is called the twelve places: eyes and forms, ears and sounds, nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and touch, mind and dhamma; and because of desire and greed in the inner and outer parts of oneself being cut off, the roots have been cut off, just like a palm tree without roots, becoming a non-existent, non-living thing for the future.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus should march (wander) mindfully”: “Mindfully” in four ways: when practicing mindfulness on the body, when practicing mindfulness on perception, when watching the mind in the heart, when the practice is in line with the teachings, it is mindful.</p>
<p>And again in four ways: the state of avoiding non-mind, the state of the Dhamma that should be done to the mind, the state of the Dhamma that is obstructed by the mind, the state of the mindfulness factor (phase) not being forgotten.</p>
<p>And in four ways: the state of possessing mindfulness, the state of abiding in mindfulness, the state of experiencing mindfulness, and the state of mindfulness not lowering.</p>
<p>And again in four ways: with the state of being mindful as the object of mindfulness, the quiet state as the object, the calm state as the object, the state of silence; the recollection of the Buddha, the recollection of the Dhamma, the recollection of the Saṅgha, the precepts, the alms, of the mind; mindfulness of the in and out breath, of death, of the body, of silence; all mindfulness, free-mindfulness…, the path without a fork, are called mindfulness. Having been fully possessed, reaching fully, possessing, arriving, with this thought, he is called mindful. “Bhikkhu,” he who destroyed the state of the seven dhammas is called Bhikkhu; seeing is destroyed, suspicion is destroyed, prohibition…, greed…, anger…, delusion…, sloth…; those evil and unwholesome dhammas are destroyed: shunning pollution (defilement), the others, the fear, the bitter fruit, will no longer live for the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One [Sn.3.6, 519]:<br />
“By his own practice,<br />
To Nibbāna, transcending skeptics,<br />
After abandoning nothingness and existence,<br />
The one who has been completed,<br />
The one who is extinct, he is a Bhikkhu.”</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus should march mindfully”: Bhikkhus should proceed mindfully, walk mindfully, stand mindfully, sit down mindfully, lie down mindfully, go forward mindfully, step back…, look forward…, observe…, bend…, straighten…, hold coats, bowls, and clothes mindfully, walk and live mindfully, act, go on, guard, survive.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the verse, for those who live with the same intention, same endeavor, same inclination, and same dwelling place as the Brāhmaṇas, the distant dust and dhamma eyes of thousands of living things arise: “Any collection of dhammas is an extinction.” The mind of the Brāhmaṇa is free from all defilements without clinging. Along with reaching the realm of the Arahant, their sheepskin clothing, knotted hair, bark clothing, sticks, long-mouthed water bottles, hair, and beards disappeared, becoming bald, replaced with robes, cloth clothes, overcoats, and bowls. They clasp their hands together to show respect to the Blessed One, and sit down: “Great Virtue! The Blessed One is my teacher, and I am a disciple.”</p>

Any kind of anger, hostility, hatred, aversion, evil, heart aversion, arrogance, aggression, rage, displeasure: this is called anger.</p>

<p>“I ask you,” …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“[Like this Venerable Mettagū]”: …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“I think you are a person who knows the Vedas and who have personally practiced”: I think you are “aware of the Vedas.” I think you are a “person who has practiced yourself,” I know so; I agree. “A person who knows the Vedas, who has already practiced himself,” How is the Blessed One one who knows the Vedas? The Vedas are called wisdom, the root of wisdom, power of wisdom, dhamma enlightenment, investigation, vipassanā, right view of the four realms. The Blessed Ones are those who have reached the ultimate (target), who have lived, aged, and died in the Vedas; those who have reached the ultimate, those who have reached the end, those who have reached the boundary, those who have reached the refuge, those who have reached the shelter, those who have reached no fear, have arrived without being dead, those who reach the undead are those who have reached Nibbāna. Or “the one who has known the Vedas” is the one who knows the Vedas, or the known state of the seven dhammas is the one who knows the Vedas: seeing being known, suspicion being known, refraining being known, greed (being known), anger (being known), ignorance (being known), sloth being known, and its evil and unwholesome methods are known: succumbing to polluting, recurring, fearing, and it will live and die in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One: [Sn.3.6, 534]<br />
“Select all the Vedas,<br />
All those belonging to the Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas that exist here,<br />
He is free from greed in all feelings,<br />
And after surpassing all Vedas, he is one who knows the Vedas well.”</p>
<p>How is he the Blessed One who has already practiced himself? The Blessed One is the person who has practiced the body, the mind, the wisdom, the mindfulness, the righteousness, studied the divine bases, the root, the power, the enlightenment. Those who have practiced the path, those who have given up the polluters, those who have been unshakable, those who have testified, those who have known, have given up, have practiced, have given up testimony, have renounced what should be renounced, practiced what ought to be practiced, not small, large, very deep, immeasurable, difficult to be; those who have a deep understanding of many treasures, such as the ocean, are those who possess six peaces:</p>

<p>After seeing form with his eyes, he does not desire, dislike, and does not cause greed to occur in the desired form. His body is already established, his mind is already established, and he is built up and liberated by virtue. After seeing the undesirable form, he does not become discouraged, have unrestrained mind, unintentional sorrow, unintentional malice; his body is already inhabited, his mind is already inhabited, and he is built up by goodness and kindness within himself.</p>

<p>There is only the seen in what you see; there is only the heard in what you hear; there is only the perceived in what you perceive; there is only the known in what you know [SN.35.95]. Do not be contaminated by in what you see; not contaminated by what you hear; not contaminated by what you perceive; not contaminated by what you know; and he who is has no obsession, (virtue) without loss, not dependent, and not bound by what is known, freed from the bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart; in terms of what he hears… (omitted) in terms of what he knows, he is the one without attachment, the one who does not lose, the one who does not depend on, and the one who is not bound. Freed from the bondage, he lives with an unrestrained heart.</p>

[Sn.3.6, 521]</p>
<p>“From where did these sufferings arise”: “From where,” the question of doubt, the question of confusion, the question of more than one question, this is a rhetorical question, ironic question, why on earth? “Suffering,” suffering from birth, suffering from old age, …from sickness, from death, sorrow, despair, loss, hell, the animal world, ghosts, human beings; rooted in suffering from birth, rooted in the suffering of living in the womb, rooted in the suffering of birth, the suffering of the living being dependent, the suffering of the living being manipulated by others, …due to their own actions, due to the actions of others, from change, eye disease, ear disease, nose disease, tongue disease, body disease, head disease, external ear disease, mouth disease, tooth disease, …(omitted, see previous sections) …the suffering of the decline of seeing. From the very beginning of these dhammas, they have been known; since they disappeared, they have been known, the retribution is based on kamma; connection is based on kamma, the name is based on form; and form is based on name. Those who are followed by arising, accompanied by birth, followed by age, conquered by disease, struck by death, living in suffering, with no shelter, and no refuge, are called suffering. Where did these sufferings come from? Where did it arise? Where is it produced? Where did it happen from? Where was it born? Where did it appear? What is the cause? What is its aggregation? What is its birth? What is its root cause? He inquired about the root of these sufferings, he inquired about the reason, he inquired about the cause, he inquired about the arising, he inquired about the emergence, he inquired and waited, he inquired about the nutriment, he inquired about the cause, he inquired about the fate, he inquired about the set, he asked and begged, requested, make it clear.</p>
<p>“Of all kinds of different shapes and forms in any world”: “Of all kinds,” all completely, every aspect completely, no surplus, the whole earth, this is the ubiquitous language, which is “all.” “In any world,” the world of suffering, the world of humans, the world of heaven, the world of aggregates, the world of worlds, and the world of existence. “Various shapes and forms,” various kinds and types of suffering.</p>

<p>“All sufferings occur due to dependence (upadhi; this could also be translated as attachment or acquisition)”: “Dependence,” there are ten kinds of dependence: dependence of craving, dependence of seeing, of pollution, of kamma, of evil deeds, the attachment to food, the attachment to disgust, to the four attachments, to the six inner states, to the six types of consciousness, and to all sufferings with heart and righteousness. “All suffering,” suffering from birth, suffering from old age, suffering from death… (omitted).

<p>This was also said by the Blessed One: “Similarly, Brāhmaṇa, Nibbāna stays and abides, the path which leads to Nibbāna stays and abides, and my persuasion (teaching) stays and abides. However, when my disciples are taught and admonished in this way, some of them reach the ultimate end of Nibbāna, and some do not reach. Brāhmaṇa, What can I do here?

</blockquote>
<p>“I asked Sakyamuni twice”: The Brāhmaṇa asked the Buddha and the Blessed One two times, but the Blessed One did not answer the question he asked (thinking) “In the middle, the roots of this Brāhmaṇa will become familiar.” “Sakyamuni” …(omitted, see previous sections). “I asked Sakyamuni twice”: I inquired, begged, requested, and asked to make it clear to Sakyamuni twice.</p>
<p>“[Like this Venerable Mogharāja]”: …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“The all-seeing one did not answer me”: “The one who has eyes did not answer for me,” did not answer, tell, explain, teach, inform, establish, uncover, analyze, and clarify for me. Five types of eyes are those who have eyes: the naked eyes are those who have eyes, the heavenly eyes are also those who have eyes, the wise eyes are also those who have eyes, the eyes of Buddha are also those who have eyes, and all-eyes are also those who have eyes.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the naked eye as “having eyes?” There are five colors in the eyes of the Blessed One: cyan, yellow, red, black, and white. The (Blessed One’s) eye hairs are blue, extremely blue, correct, beautiful, and equivalent to flax, and the others are yellow, extremely yellow, golden, and correct, beautiful, the equal of the flower of the bayur tree. The two eyes of the Blessed One are red, extremely red, straight, beautiful, red as the insects that come from the ground after the rain, and in the middle are black, extremely black, not coarse, smooth, straight, beautiful, and moist. The outers are white, extremely white, white, yellow-white, pleasing, beautiful, and equivalent to the Osadhī star. With the naked eyes of the Blessed One which belonged to him naturally having been born of previous good kamma, he sees everything in day and night, when there are four branches of darkness: sunset, moonless night, darkness of the heavy forest, the darkness of heavy clouds. Like this, when there is the darkness of the four branches, he also sees everything in day and night. There are no walls, or shutters, or fences, or mountains, or bushes, or groves, which are obstacles to his vision of form. If a sesame is marked and put into a cart full of sesame, he can select that sesame. In this way, the Blessed One’s natural naked eye is pure, and the Blessed One regards the naked eye as an eye.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the heavenly eye as “the one with eyes?” With a pure and transcendent celestial eye, the Blessed One sees that when all beings die and pass away, they are inferior, triumphant, beautiful, ugly, fortunate, and unfortunate, knowing that all beings flow according to their kamma: “These beings and monarchs have evil deeds of body, evil deeds of behavior, evil deeds of intention, rebuke the saints, wrong views and kamma of holding wrong views, they have passed away after death to the suffering realm, evil returning, lower realm, hell; or these beings, who have good deeds of body, good deeds of speech, good deeds of intentions, do not condemn the saints, and uphold the right view of the kamma, they have passed away to the world of goodness and heaven after death by disintegrating their bodies.” In this way, with a pure and transcendent celestial eye, he saw that when all beings died and passed away, in the inferiority, victory, beauty, ugliness, fortune, and misfortune, he knew the flow of all beings according to kamma. When he wants, the Blessed One can see one world, two worlds, three worlds, four worlds, five worlds, and ten worlds. Also, twenty world realms, thirty world realms, forty…, fifty…, one hundred, these thousand small worlds, two thousand middle world realms, as well as these three hundred thousand great world realms [AN.3.81]. If he wants to, he can see it. In this way, the Blessed One’s heavenly eyes are all pure, and the Blessed One regards the heavenly eyes as having eyes.</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard the wise eyes as the one with eyes? The Blessed One is the great wisdom, broad wisdom, quick wisdom, sharp wisdom, piercing wisdom, advising wisdom: those who are skillful, those who have developed wisdom, those who have proved that they have reached the unimpeded, those who have reached the four fearless ones, those who possess ten powers, those who are like bulls, those who are like lions, those who can have great wealth, those with boundless wisdom, those with boundless brilliance, those with boundless fame, the rich, the wealthy, the guide, the moderator, the comforter, the informer, the one who makes it seen, the one who makes it visible, the one who makes it clear, the Blessed One is indeed the founder of the unborn Path, the producer of the unborn Path, the unannounced preacher; the one who knows the Path, the knower of the Path, and, (his) disciples now live in the Path’s accompaniment, and will be the possessors in the future.</p>
<p>The Blessed One is indeed the knower and seer, who knows and sees; he is the one who is born with eyes, born with wisdom, born with Dhamma, and born with Brahma; he is an interpreter and promoter of righteousness, the immortal giver, Dhamma King, Tathāgata; there is nothing that the Blessed One did not know, did not see, did not testify (prove), did not touch with wisdom; the past, the future, and the present came to the Buddha and the Blessed One with all the deeds in the field of wisdom, anyone with any name that should be guided to reason can know: one’s own righteousness or others’ righteousness or both, or the righteousness of the current life or the righteousness of the next life or both, or deep or hidden, or should be guided to infer, or have been guided to determine, or no fault or pollution, or clear or supreme interest, everything revolves in the Buddha’s wisdom.</p>
<p>All body kamma is transferred in the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One; all language kamma…; all mental kamma…; the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One about the past is barrier-free; ..future…; …present…; all that should be guided to infer is the reach of wisdom; all wisdom is guided to be inferred, and all that should be guided to be inferred is the ultimate wisdom; the ultimate wisdom is what is guided to be deduced, and there is no wisdom beyond what is guided to be deduced; there is no way to transcend the wisdom that is guided and deduced. These dhammas live in mutual restriction, such as two boxes, where the covers are completely in contact; the lower cover does not go over the upper one, and the upper cover does not go over the lower one; restricted to each other. (Similarly, ) all that should be guided… (omitted); these dhammas live in mutual restriction.</p>
<p>The wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred in all the Dhamma, all the Dhamma is the Buddha, the Blessed One’s turning belongs, the hope belongs, the intention belongs, the mind arises, the wisdom of the Buddha and the Blessed One is transferred to all living beings, the Blessed One knows the intentions of all living beings, knows the potential tendency of troubles, …the behavior, …solution, about the less dusty, the more dusty; the rooted, the dull rooted, the good deeds, the evil deeds, and the teachability and unteachability of beings; capable and incapable sentient beings, including the world of heaven, demons, and Brāhmaṇa; generations of Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven, and man all revolve in the wisdom of Buddha.</p>
<p>If any fish, turtles, and even the big fish swallowing boats revolve in the sea, the same, including the world of heaven, the world of demons, and the world of Brāhmaṇa; the generations including Samaṇas, Brāhmaṇas, heaven and man are all turned around in the Buddha wisdom, such as any bird and even the gold-winged birds were turning around in the field of space. In the same way, those who possess the same wisdom as Sāriputta also revolve in the field of Buddha wisdom. The wisdom of the Buddha is pervasive and transcends heaven and human.</p>
<p>Those wise khattiya, wise Brāhmaṇas, wise homeowners, wise Samaṇas, smart dissidents, sharp breakers who want to act on evil views with a wise attitude, they prepare problems to be seen later; they saw the Tathāgata and asked about the what is hidden and secret. Those questions were discussed and answered by the Blessed One with reasons, and they abandoned those (others) nearby and became the (disciples) of the Blessed One. At that time, the Blessed One was there, shining with wisdom. In this way, the Blessed One regards the insight as an eye.</p>
<p>How is it that the Buddha’s eyes are “the one who as eyes?” When the Blessed One observes the world with the eyes of the Buddha, he sees those with less dust and more dust; those with roots and blunt roots; …good deeds and evil deeds; …easy to teach and difficult to teach; the existing sins and terrors of the other worlds, others who do not live in seeing sin and terror in other worlds. Just like in the green lotus pond, red lotus pond, and white lotus pond, some green lotus, red lotus, and white lotus grow in the water, rest on the surface of the water, sink and grow underwater; some …are born in the water and grow in the water, and live on the same height (as the surface); some …rise above the water and live and dwell without being stained by water. Similarly, when the Blessed One observes the world with the eyes of the Buddha, he sees those with less dust and more dust; … [DN.14]. The Blessed One knows: “This person is a greedy person, this person is an abusive person, this person is a foolish person, this person is a pathfinder, this person is a believer, and this person is a wise person.” The Blessed One speaks to the greedy people, the Blessed One informs those who hate walkers of the practice of compassion, the Blessed One makes them settled in recitation, questioning, hearing of the Dhamma at the right time, discussion of the Dhamma at the right time, and co-living with teachers. The Blessed One informs the person who seeks the path, the Blessed One tells those who believe in confidence: the good sense of Buddha, the good nature of the Dhamma, the good practice of the Saṅgha and his precepts. The Blessed One teaches vipassanā to those who are wise practitioners: impermanence, suffering, and non-self.</p>
<p>“If you stand on the top of a rocky mountain,<br />
You can see all the people around,<br />
Similarly, those who are virtuous and all-seeing<br />
Climbed up the tall building of Dhamma.<br />
Those who are gone away, looking at people<br />
Who are in sorrow, conquered by birth and old age.<br />
Please get up! Heroes! Victors on the battlefield! Caravan leaders!<br />
Debt-free people, walk in the world,<br />
Blessed One! Please teach the Dhamma!<br />
There will be those who understand.”<br />
[DN.14]</p>
<p>How does the Blessed One regard all eyes as having eyes? All eyes are called the state all knowing wisdom. The Blessed One arrives (has), fully arrives (has), enters, fully enters, has enough, has all the state wisdom of knowing.</p>
<p>“For him, there is nothing unseen here (in this world),<br />
There is no knowledge that cannot be known,<br />
He proves that everything that exists should be guided by inference,<br />
Because the Tathāgata, like that, is all-eyes.”<br />

<p>“I have heard that on the third time, the divine rishi will answer”: “On the third time, the Buddha and the Dhamma master will answer the question asked, which has not been answered.” This was learned by me, understood and distinguished by me, like this. “Divine rishi,” The Blessed One is a divine rishi. For example, A king who is a bhikkhu is called a king rishi; a Brāhmaṇa who is a bhikkhu is called a Brāhmaṇa rishi. Similarly, the Blessed One is a divine rishi.</p>
<p>Or, “The Blessed One is a bhikkhu.” is also a rishi; and the “seekers and pursuers of the great precepts” are the great rishis…(omitted, see previous sections).</p>

<p>“Please observe that the world is empty”: “The world,” …(omitted, see previous sections). A certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One [SN.35.82]: “Great Virtue! What is called ‘World, the world,’ Great Virtue! What is called ‘World?’” “Bhikkhu! ‘Broken,’ so it is called ‘World.’ And what is ‘broken?’ Bhikkhu! The eye is broken, form is broken, eye consciousness is broken, eye contact is broken, and all that arises from this eye contact is either happiness or suffering, or neither suffering nor happiness is also broken. Ear …(omitted); smell …; taste …; the body is broken, touch is broken…; Dhamma is broken, consciousness is dissipated, and mental touch is dissipated. Any happiness, suffering, or unpleasantness that arises from this mind is also dissipated. Bhikkhu! ‘Broken,’ so it is called ‘The world.’”</p>
<p>“Please observe that the world is empty”: Observe that the world is empty for two reasons: because of the consideration of not going on freely or the consideration of being empty. How to observe that the world is empty due to the consideration of not going on? The freedom in form cannot be obtained, the freedom in feeling cannot be obtained, …in thinking…, …in action…, and the freedom in consciousness cannot be obtained. This was said by the Blessed One [SN.22.59]:</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus! Form is without self, bhikkhus, because if this form is me, this form will not cause disease, and I will also obtain form: ‘My form, be like this; my form, don’t be like this.’ But, bhikkhus! Because form is selfless, therefore, form causes disease and I cannot form: ‘My form should be like this; my form should not be like this.’</p>
<p>Bhikkhus! Feeling is without self, ….<br />
Bhikkhus! Thinking is without self, …. Bhikkhus! Action is without self, ….<br />
Bhikkhus! Consciousness is without self, …."</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One [SN.12.37]: "Bhikkhus! This body is not yours, nor other people’s, bhikkhus! This is old kamma, which should be seen as being made, created by thought, and can be felt. There, bhikkhus! There are the holy disciples who have heard of the reason-based (dependent) origination: ‘Like this, when this exists, there is that; when this arises, that arises; when this does not exist, there is no that; when this is extinguished, that is extinguished; that is: ignorance is the condition for action; action is conditional for knowledge; consciousness is conditional for name and form; with mind and form as condition, there are six sense bases; there is contact with the condition; the feeling with the contact; the thirst with the feeling; the taking with the thirst; the taking with the condition; the living with the being; with the living, predestined conditions arise from old age, death, sorrow, bitterness, suffering, worry, and despair.’ This is the collection of the entire suffering.</p>
<p>When ignorance fades and perishes, choice ceases…(omitted); this is how the mass of suffering is destroyed."</p>
<p>How can we make the observation that the world is empty? Solidity in form cannot be obtained, solidity in feeling cannot be obtained, solidity in thinking cannot be obtained, solidity in behavior cannot be obtained, and solidity in consciousness cannot be obtained. That form is always solid, or pleasure is solid, or “I” is solid, or constant, or eternal, or persistent, or with constant change; feeling…, thinking…(omitted); such as the reed is not solid…, castor-oil plant…, fig tree…, white reeds…, palash tree…, blisters…, the flame of the sun…, the plantain trunk…, non-solid, leaving solid. In the same way, form is not solid….</p>
<p>Or, observe that the world is empty for six reasons: the eyes are empty of ‘me,’ or with what we are, or with constancy, or with eternity, or with unchanging methods; ears… (omitted); feeling…; thinking…; doing…; knowing…; Dhamma…; form…; sound…; smell…; taste…; touch…; dhamma…; eye consciousness…; consciousness…; eye touch…; consciousness…; eye contact and sound…; mental touch and sound…; form thinking…; dhamma thinking…; form cognition…; dhamma cognition…; the craving for form…; …craving for dhammas….</p>
<p>Or, observe that the world is empty for ten reasons: physicality is renounced, vain, empty, selfless, false, executed, nothingness, unlucky root, troublesome, producing, conditioned; feeling…, thinking…, being…, knowing…, death…, being born…, existence…, revolving…, reincarnation….</p>
<p>Or, observe that the world is empty for twelve reasons: form is not a living being, not a life, not a human being, not a student Brāhmaṇa, not a woman, not a man, not the real self, not what we are, not me, not mine, not anyone, not of anyone; feeling…, thinking…, action…, consciousness….</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One [SN.22.33]: “Bhikkhus! Whatever is not you, you must give up! If you give up it, it will be of long-term benefit and happiness for you. And, bhikkhus! What form not yours? Bhikkhus! What is not yours, you let it go! Let it go, it will have long-term benefits and happiness for you; feeling…, thinking…, doing…, if they don’t know you, let it go! Let it go, …. Bhikkhus! Do you think in this forest, people will take away grass, fuel wood, branches, leaves, or burn it, or do what he wants, you will think like this: ‘People take us, or burn it, or do what he wants?’ ‘No, Great Virtue! What’s the reason for that? Great Virtue! Because this is not me, nor what I belong to.’ ‘Similarly, Bhikkhus! Whatever is not yours, you must give up! Give it away, …. And, bhikkhus! What is not yours? ….’”</p>
<p>Venerable Ānanda said to the World-Venerable [SN.35.85]: “It is called: ‘The world is emptiness, the world is emptiness,’ Great Virtue! What situation is called ‘the world is emptiness?’” “Ānanda, because ‘me’ or ‘what I am’ is emptiness, so it is called ‘the world is emptiness.’ Ānanda, what is emptiness in ‘me’ or ‘what I am?’ Ānanda, eyes are empty in me or what I am, form…, eye consciousness…, eye contact…, in all happiness, suffering, or unpleasantness that arises from this eye contact, ‘me’ or ‘my being’ are empty; ear…, sound…, smell…, taste…, body…, touch…, mind…, dhamma…, consciousness…, intention…; Ānanda, because ‘I’ or ‘my being’ is empty, it is called ‘The world is empty.’”</p>
<p>“It’s purely the arising of dhammas,<br />
Purely the continuation of actions,<br />
For those who see it truthfully,<br />
Village chief, he has no fear.<br />
The world is the same grass and trees;<br />
When seeing this with wisdom,<br />
One will not expect anything else,<br />
At other junctions.”<br />
[Thag.715-717]</p>
<p>This was said by the Blessed One [SN.35.246]: “Similarly, bhikkhus! Bhikkhus search for form anywhere it may be reborn; …feelings…; …perceptions…; …choices…; …behaviors..; …consciousness…; when he searches for forms in this way, thoughts of ‘I,’ ‘mine,’ or ‘I am’ no longer exist…; …feelings… (omitted).”</p>
<p>“Please observe that the world is empty”: The world is empty, please observe, please examine, please see, please measure, please judge, please distinguish, please figure out.</p>
<p>“Mogharāja! Always mindful”: “Mogharāja,” … “Always,” …. Mindful in four ways: …(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“After removing the view of self”: “The view of self” is known as the twenty grounds of seeing. Here, the ordinary people who have not heard of the Holy One, have never seen the saints, those who are not proficient in the Dhamma, and have not been trained in the Dhamma; they have never seen the Dhamma of good people, are unskilled in the Dhamma, and have not been trained in the good Dhamma. They think that form is self, or ‘I’ have form, or form is in ‘me,’ or ‘I’ am in form, …feeling…, …thinking…, …consciousness… [SN.22.1], where such views, evil views, jungle (entangled) views, desert (barren) views, distorted views, shaken views, and bound views, they hold, accept, cling to, evil ways, evil path, evil nature, the place where the outer path rests, the clasp of inversion (vipariyesa), the clasp of inversion (viparīta), the clasp of inversion (vipallāsa), the clasp of evil, (seeing) as true the non-true, all come to the reach of the sixty-two evil views, this is seeing the view of self. “After removing the view of self”: After removal of the self-view, after eradication, after disconnection, after pulling out, after complete removal, after abandoning, after expelling, after finishing, making it go to non-existence.</p>
<p>“In this way, you can overcome death”: In this way, you can save yourself from birth, you can save yourself from aging, you can save yourself from death, you can transcend, you can pass, you can surpass, you can overcome.</p>
<p>“Those who observe the world in this way”: Those who observe, examine, measure, judge, distinguish, and clarify the world in this way are those who observe the world in this way.</p>
<p>“The king of death cannot see”: Death is the king of death; demons are also the king of death. “Invisible,” to the king of death, invisible, unseen, unobtained, not found, not gotten. This was said by the Blessed One [MN.25]:</p>
<p>"Bhikkhus! Just like a deer living in the woods, walking with peace of mind when walking in the woods and forests, standing with peace of mind, sitting with peace of mind, lying with peace of mind, what is that? The reason? Bhikkhus! That’s a realm that violent people can’t reach. Similarly, bhikkhus! Here, the bhikkhus live in search and wait after entering after renunciation from desires and unwholesome dhamma, and happiness and joy after being separated. First jhāna, Bhikkhus! This is called the bhikkhu blinding the demon. After killing the demon’s eyes, the demon enters a state of not seeing and footlessness (misfortune).</p>
<p>Besides, bhikkhus! Bhikkhus calm down with reasoning and thinking, confident, and one mind. After entering, they live in the second jhāna where there is no reasoning and no thinking, and concentration produces joy and happiness…, the third jhāna…, after entering, dwell in neither suffering nor happiness, the fourth jhāna from calm and chanting, bhikkhus! This is called the bhikkhu making the demon blind. After killing the demon’s eyes, ….</p>
<p>Again, bhikkhus! Bhikkhus transcend all lusts and thoughts, with the extinction of opposing thoughts, without thinking about all kinds of thoughts, (and know): ‘Void is boundless,’ after entering, live in the boundless void, bhikkhus! This is called the bhikkhu making the demon blind. After killing the demon’s eyes, ….</p>
<p>Besides, bhikkhus! After a Bhikkhu transcends all emptiness and boundlessness (and knowledge): ‘Consciousness is boundless,’ after entering, live in the boundlessness of consciousness….</p>
<p>Besides, bhikkhus! After a Bhikkhu transcends all the boundless places of consciousness (and knows): ‘There is nothing,’ after entering, live in the boundless places….</p>
<p>Besides, bhikkhus! After the bhikkhu transcends everything and nothingness, he enters and lives in a place where there is neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
<p>Besides, bhikkhus! After the bhikkhu transcends all neither thinking nor non-thinking things, he enters and stays in wanting to be destroyed. After seeing with wisdom, his troubles are destroyed, bhikkhus! This is called the Bhikkhu blinding the demon. After killing the demon’s eyes, the demon enters a state of not seeing and footlessness, letting go of his attachment to the world. He walks, stands, sits, lies down in peace. What is the reason? The Bhikkhu is an unreachable area for the demon."</p>

All sentient beings are beaten, killed, hurt, and tormented because of their physical causes and physical conditions. When there is form, various penalties are imposed: whipping, beating with a stick, beating with a cane, cutting off hands, feet, hands and feet, ears, nose, ears and nose, punishing with sour porridge, shell-baldness, Rāhu mouth torture, fire torture, candle hand torture, exorcism torture, bark torture, antelope torture, hook torture, money torture, alkaline bath torture, torsion torture, straw foot torture, hot oil, dog bites, the order to be pierced and beheaded with a sword; so sentient beings are beaten, killed, hurt, and tormented by the physical cause and physical condition.

Along with reaching the realm of the Arahant, their sheepskin clothing, knotted hair, bark clothing, sticks, long-mouthed water bottles, hair, and beards disappeared, becoming bald, replaced with robes, cloth clothes, overcoats, and bowls.

Who has reached the edge of the world, surpassing all (existences),<br />
Who has no troubles, gives up all suffering, who is truly called (a Sambuddha),<br />
Brāhmaṇa! He is served by me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Dispelling the dark, enlightened, and all-seeing”: “Dispelling the dark,” the darkness of greed, the darkness of aversion, …ignorance, …sloth, seeing…, pollution…, …evil, blindness, lack of wisdom, destruction of wisdom, vexing factions, that which does not lead to Nibbāna; to exclude, remove, abandon, drive away, end, and make it go to non-existence. “That is the Blessed One….” All eyes are called the state of all knowing wisdom…(omitted, see previous sections).</p>
<p>“Those who have reached the edge of the world, surpassing all others”: “World,” one world: the world of existence; two worlds: the world of existence and the arising world; what has become into the world and what arises becomes the world; there is the world of degeneration and the degeneration of the arising of the world. Three worlds: three feelings. Four worlds: four nutriments. Five worlds: five accumulations. Six worlds: six inner worlds. Seven worlds: seven consciousness dwellings. Eight worlds: eight world systems. Nine worlds: where the nine living beings live. Ten worlds: ten places. Twelve worlds: twelve places. Eighteen worlds: eighteen worlds. “Those who have reached the edge of the world,” The Blessed One is the one who has reached the edge of the world; has reached the end; …reached the Nibbāna; arrived at the Nibbāna, …descended into the state, …practiced …the cycle of life and death, without his rebirth.</p>
<p>“Beyond all,” there are two types of “beyond all”: in kamma and rebirth. What is kamma? Blessed deeds, non-blessed deeds, and immovable deeds are kamma. What is rebirth?

<p>105 · For example, as a bird will live in a fruity forest<br />
After abandoning a small forest,<br />
After I abandon all those of narrow views like this,<br />
I am like a goose which has reached the great lake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“For example, as after a bird abandons a small forest, it will live in a fruity forest”: A bird (twice-born) is called a bird (winged). Why is a bird born twice called winged? “Born twice” is born twice: from mother’s uterus and the egg shell, born twice for this reason, so twice-born are called winged. “Like after abandoning a small forest,” like a bird, a small mountain forest with little fruit, food, and water, after abandoning, after going beyond, after passing, after leaving, you will get, find, and obtain other fruits, large forests and dense forests with lots of food and plenty of water, will build shelter in that dense forest.</p>
<p>“Like this, after I abandon those of narrow views, it is as a goose has reached the great lake”: “Like this” is a metaphorical arrangement. “After abandoning those of narrow views,” Bāvari Brāhmaṇa and other his teachers compared with the Buddha and Blessed One, those who are rare, insignificant, inferior, lesser, little-seen, lower, non-supreme, inferior; after abandoning, after leaving, surpassing, passing, and transcending, the best-seen one obtains, finds, and gets the Buddha, the Blessed One: the immeasurable seer, the top seer, the unequal, the unparalleled, the uncontrasted, incomparable, heaven in the sky, bull king among men, lion among men, elephant among men, virtuous man with strong endurance among men, holder of ten powers. For example, as the geese will get, find, and obtain the large man-made or the natural pool, or the unshakable and immeasurable water accumulation of the sea-lake; similarly, the Buddha and the Blessed One are the unshakable ones, those with infinite brilliance, those who have developed wisdom, …have discerning eyes, …are clever, have proven to be unobstructed, have reached the four fearless ones, have pure aspirations, are white-covered (pure), do not talk, claim to be like that, are not small, are great, are deep, cannot be measured, are difficult to penetrate, have vast treasures, are equal to the ocean, have six peaces, are incomparable, are vast, and those who cannot be measured; he is the speaker like that, the speaker of the Path, like Mount Meru among the mountains, like the gold-winged bird among the birds, like the lion among the beasts, like the river reaching the sea, he is the master, the winner, the top one, and the great rishi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>106 · Whatever they told me before, before Gotama’s teaching:<br />

<p>107 · The one who is alone, the disperser of darkness,<br />
The seated one, the shining one, the creator of light,<br />
The Blessed One, wise,<br />
The Blessed One, broadly wise,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“The one who is alone, the one who disperses the darkness, and the one who is sitting down”: “One who is alone,” the Blessed One is alone having become a bhikkhu, with no partner for righteousness as alone, with thirst for righteousness as alone, and “always free from greed” as alone, “always free from delusion” as alone, “always free from depravity” as alone, “always no pollution” as alone, “crossing the road without a fork” as alone, and “has already realized the highest enlightenment” as alone.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone having become a bhikkhu? When the Blessed One was young, the black-haired youth possessed the happiness of youth. At the beginning of life, even if the parents didn’t want (this), tearful, crying, and sighing, they still abandon their relatives, cut off all obstacles in the home, and cut off the barrier of their children and wife, …family, …friend, …storage (warehouse), shave their hair and put on robes, go out from their home, being a bhikkhu in a non-domestic life, into a state of no possessions, then walk alone, live, act, go on, guard, and survive.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone without a partner? When he was such a bhikkhu, he was alone in the woods, wild forests, and border dwellings (sitting places): quiet, away from the atmosphere, living alone, suitable for sitting alone; he would walk alone, stand alone, sit alone, lie alone, enter the village alone for alms, go forward alone, return alone, sit alone in a quiet place, perform alone, live, move, go on, guard, and survive alone.</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One alone with the disruption of thirsting love? He is so alone and without a partner, when he lived in reluctance, zealous, and self-effort. Under the Bodhi tree by the Nerañjarā River, with diligence and effort, destroying the devil (Māra) accompanied by the army, the evil demon, and the relatives of the relaxed; afterwards, the netted, strong flowing, entangled thirsty loves, he abandoned, drove away, ended, and made to go to no-existence.</p>
<p>“People who have thirsty love as their partner,<br />
Reincarnate for a long time,<br />
Become such a state, other states,<br />
Do not go beyond reincarnation.<br />
Knowing this kind of trouble:<br />
Craving is the origin of suffering,<br />
Departing from thirsty love, without taking,<br />
Bhikkhus should march mindfully.”<br />
[It.15/Sn.3.12,745-746]</p>
<p>How can the Blessed One be alone being always away from greed? “To abandon the state of greed” as aloneness, “to abandon the state of anger”, …the state of delusion…, the state of of contamination….</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One one who has passed the road without a fork as alone? The road without forks is called the four mindfulnesses… (omitted, see previous sections) eight sacred Paths.</p>
<p>“The one who sees the death of life (rebirth), the compassionate one,<br />
Who knows the way without forks,<br />
Using this way, they crossed torrents in the past,<br />
Will cross (in the future), and are (crossing) in the present.”<br />
[SN.47.18]</p>
<p>How is the Blessed One’s single enlightenment being alone? Enlightenment is called wisdom, root of wisdom, power of wisdom, enlightenment of choice, investigation, vipassanā, right view of the four realms. The Blessed One realized that “all actions are impermanent,”..(omitted). “every collection of dhammas is extinguished.” Or, everything that should be felt, should be conscious, should be awakened, should be enlightened, should be realized, should be touched, should be testified, everything is conscious of that consciousness, awakening, enlightenment, attainment, reaching, testifying.</p>
<p>“Dispelling the darkness,” …. “Sitting down,” The Blessed One is sitting at the Rock Temple.</p>
<p>“When Muni was sitting on the hillside,<br />
He who had reached the other side of suffering,<br />
The disciples served, with the three knowledges,<br />
Destroyers of death.”<br />
[SN.8.10]</p>
<p>Or, in the state where all efforts have ceased, the Blessed One is the one who sits, the one who has descended, and the one who has practiced….</p>
<p>“He is the shining person, the creator of the light”: The shining person is the wise, supremely wise, enlightened, distinguished, and wise. “The luminous creator,” Creator of light, illuminator, bringer of light.</p>
<p>“Blessed One is the one who is broadly wise”: Blessed One is the one who symbolizes the vastness, wisdom is the symbol, wisdom is the flag, wisdom is the marker, wisdom is increased, wisdom is abundant, the more deliberate, the fully deliberate nature, the one who lives in the understanding, the character, the more, the serious, the object of that, the inclination, the lean, the winner, and the better.</p>
<p>“The flag is the sign of the chariot,<br />
The smoke is the sign of the fire,<br />
The king is the symbol of the country,<br />
And the husband is the symbol of the woman.”<br />

<p>“The one who teaches me the Dhamma”: “The one,” that is the one who is the world-honored person, the solo person, and the one without a teacher who has realized the truth in the Dhamma that has not been heard before, and reaches the state of all knowing there, one who is in a state of freedom in strength. “Teaching the Dhamma,” “Dhamma,” the beginning is good …(omitted); he explained, taught, informed, established, uncovered, analyzed, and clarified.</p>
<p>“Directly visible, immediate”: Directly visible, immediate, you are invited to meet, guided, and the wise should experience it for himself. Or, he practices the eight sacred paths, he realizes that way indiscriminately and immediately, and he finds and obtains results. “Immediate,” such as when someone leaves wealth to someone when they die, they wait for that time; the Dhamma is indeed not this. Anyone who is practising the Eight Noble Paths in his life will realize that path indiscriminately and immediately. He finds and obtains the Fruit, not elsewhere (the next life), not in the other world (the next life), this is instant.</p>
<p>“Extinction of thirst, no disaster”: “Thirst for love,” the thirst for form…. “Extinction of thirst,” extinction of thirst, …of greed, of hatred, …delusion, interest, past rebirth, knot of rebirth, some, reincarnation, rotation. “No disaster,” pollution and formation are called disasters, the renunciation of catastrophes, the cessation of catastrophes, the disruption of catastrophes, the discontinuation of catastrophes, non-living, and Nibbāna.</p>

What is a learned debater? Here, a certain type of people are learners of the language of the Buddha (the teachings of the Buddha): Suttas, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gātha, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhuta Dhamma, Vedalla, who rely on his learning, this is a learned debater.</p>
<p>What is a debater who asks repeatedly (questions)?

Those who have known the reason, known the method, and known the word are the ones who defend in the known principle, defend the dhamma in the known dhamma, and the words in the known words. The three kinds of wisdom are not hindered. Understanding wisdom, the Blessed One …possessing this argument will not hinder the understanding of wisdom. Therefore, the Buddha is a talented person. If he hasn’t learned, questioned, and proved, what will he answer?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Knowing the Supreme Heaven”: “Heaven,” there are three kinds of heavens: …(omitted, see previous sections).

In the same way, the Blessed One is the leader of the caravan and enables all living beings to pass through dangerous zone: make them pass through the danger zone of life, …of age, disease, death, sadness, sorrow, suffering, worry, despair, greed, anger, foolishness, conceit, seeing, pollution, evil deeds; he crosses the dense forest of greed, the dense forest of anger, …of foolishness, conceit, seeing, pollution, evil deeds;, he makes them come out, makes them through, makes them pass, makes them reach stability, non-living, and Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Or, the Blessed One is the guide, the moderator, the comforter, the informer, the one who makes it deliberate, the one who sees it, and the one who makes it clear. Or, the Blessed One is the founder of the unborn Path, the producer of the unborn Path, the unannounced preacher; the one who knows the Path, the knower of the Path, the acquaintance of the Path, and (his) disciples now live in the companionship of the Path, and will be the possessors in the future.</p>

<p>(I have chosen to use the term “Rhinoceros” rather than “Rhinoceros Horn;” there is some debate about this, but a decision had to be made one way or the other. The message in the verses is the same either way.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>121 · After putting down the rod against all living things,<br />
Hurting none of them,<br />
You shouldn’t want a son, much less a companion;<br />
One should walk alone like a rhinoceros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“After putting down the rod against all living things”: “All things,” all completely, completely in every aspect, without surplus, and the whole, this is the word of ubiquity, which is “everything.” “Students” are called the weak and the strong. The “cowards” belong to those who tremble and those who have not been cut off in their thirst, as well as those who are terrified and afraid of not being cut off. For what reason are they called the cowards? They tremble, have fear, terror, come to fear, and for this reason they are called cowards. “Strong ones” belong to those who have been cut off from trembling and thirst, and those who have been cut off from fear and terror. For what reason are they called the strong? They do not tremble, have fear, terror, or come to fear, and for this reason they are called strong. “Rods,” there are three kinds of rods: body rods, speech rods, and mind rods. There are three kinds of rods for the body, four kinds of rods for evil acts and three kinds of rods for evil intentions.</p>
<p>“Hurting none of them”: The life of each sentient being will not be injured by clods, or sticks, or swords, or chains, or ropes. Do not use mud or sticks or rods or swords or chains or ropes on any living beings.</p>
<p>“Should not want a son, much less other companions” “No” is negative. “Sons,” there are four kinds of sons: sons born to oneself, sons born in the field, adopted sons, and apprentices. “Companion,” with whomever one has a happy relationship, a happy coming, a happy communication, a happy standing, a happy sitting, a happy lying, a happy talking, a happy conversation, a happy talking, a happy interlocutor is called a companion. “You shouldn’t want sons, much less companions”: A son, you shouldn’t want, accept, hope, or pray for; acquaintances, you shouldn’t ….; or a close person, or a companion.</p>
<p>“One should walk alone like a rhinoceros”: “Alone,” the alone-enlightened person is alone having become a bhikkhu, alone in the righteousness without a partner, alone in the righteousness of the thirst for love, “always free from greed” is alone, “always free from anger” is alone, “always free from delusion” is alone, “always free from defilement” is alone, “having passed the road without forks” is alone, “already realized the highest self-enlightenment” is alone.</p>
<p>How is that alone-enlightened person alone having become a bhikkhu? After the alone-enlightened person cut off all obstacles to home, after cutting off the obstacles of children and wife, …of relatives, …of friends, of storage, shaves off his hair, after being wrapped in robes, he went from being a bhikkhu at home to a non-house life, and after entering a state of nothingness, he walked, lived, moved, went on, guarded, and survived.</p>
<p>How is it that the alone-enlightened person who is alone without a partner? When he was such a bhikkhu, he was alone in the woods, wild forests, and border dwellings (sitting places): quiet, away from the atmosphere, living alone, suitable for sitting alone; he would walk alone, stand alone, sit alone, lie alone, enter the village alone for alms, go forward alone, return alone, sit alone in a quiet place, perform alone, walk alone, live, move, go on, guard, and survive alone.</p>
<p>How is the alone-enlightened person in the thirst for love and righteousness as alone? He is so alone and without a partner, he should live in reluctance, zeal, self-effort, great diligence, and diligence, after destroying the demon accompanied by the army, the evil demon, the relatives of the liberated, the net, the strong mobile, abandoning the entangled thirsty love, driving away, making to end, making it go to non-existence.</p>
<p>“People who have thirsty love as their partner,<br />
Reincarnate for a long time,<br />
Become such a state, other states,<br />
Do not go beyond reincarnation.<br />
Knowing this kind of trouble:<br />
Craving is the origin of suffering,<br />
Departing from thirsty love, without taking,<br />
Bhikkhus should march mindfully.”<br />
[It.15/Sn.3.12,745-746]</p>
<p>How can the one who is alone in enlightenment consider always free from greed as alone? “Take one of the states of greed to renounce greed” as being alone, to renounce greed in one of the states is aloneness, one of the states of renunciation of ignorance is to be alone, and one of the state of renunciation of ignorance is to be alone.</p>
<p>How is that alone-enlightened person has crossed the road without fork as alone? The path without a fork is called the four mindfulnesses, the four righteousnesses, the four divine bases, the five senses, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, and the eight sacred paths.</p>
<p>“The one who sees the death of life (rebirth), the compassionate one,<br />
Who knows the way without forks,<br />
Using this way, they crossed torrents in the past,<br />
Will cross (in the future), and are (crossing) in the present.”<br />
[SN.47.18]</p>
<p>How is that alone-enlightened person has been enlightened alone, the supreme independent enlightenment as alone? Enlightenment is called wisdom, root of wisdom, power of wisdom, investigation, vipassanā, and right view in the four realms. The one who is enlightened independently by the way, enlightened by the Path, and enlightened with the wisdom, alone, feels that “all actions are impermanent,” that “all actions are suffering,” that “all dhammas are selfless,” that “knowledge is dependent on deeds,” that “knowledge is a dependency for name and form,” that “touch is based on six sense bases,” that “feeling is based on touch,” “feeling is a dependency for thirst for love,” “thirst and love …for grasping;” “grasping …for existence,” " existence (becoming) …for birth," “birth …for old age and death;” “the extinguishment of ignorance”…, of formation, …of consciousness, …of name and form…, (omitted);" “this is suffering,” …“this is the collection of suffering,” “this is the extinguishing of suffering,” this is the path leading to suffering, “these are troubles,” “this is the collection of troubles,” “this is the path leading to troubles,” “these dhammas should be known,” “these dhammas should be cut off,” “these dhammas should be testified to,” “these dhammas should be practiced;” felt the gathering, destruction, pleasure, trouble, and renunciation of the six touches; the gathering of the abundance…; the gathering of perception, the extinction, the pleasure, the trouble, and the renunciation.</p>
<p>Or, where (any) should be felt, should be conscious, should be awakened, should be enlightened, should be proven, should be touched, should be testified, everything is subject to that alone, awareness, awakening, enlightenment, attainment, touch (contact), and testimony. In this way, the one who has been enlightened alone is alone.</p>
<p>“Should do,” there are eight types of behaviors: prestige behaviors, conduct behaviors, mindful behaviors, fixed behaviors, wisdom behaviors, Path, reaching, and world benefits. “Behavior” is about the four behaviors, “walking” is about the six inner and outer regions, “mindfulness” is about the four mindfulnesses, “meditation” is about the four kinds of jhāna, and “wisdom” is about the four noble truths. “The Path” refers to the Four Noble Ways, “reaching” refers to the Four Samaṇa Fruits, and “world benefits” refers to the Tathāgata, Arahants, fully enlightened ones, alone-enlightened ones, and disciples. The act of conduct belong to those who have sufficient vows, behavior belongs to those who guard the roots, mindfulness and behavior belong to those who do not let go, fixed behavior belongs to those who strive to increase the mind, and wisdom and behavior belong to those who have enough. For those who do, the Path belongs to the righteous person, the attainment action belongs to the attained person, and the world-benefit actions belong to the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Enlightened One, and the disciples of the Enlightened One.</p>
<p>The next eight types of behavior: the victorious (who overcome the problems) will act with faith, those who strive with vitality will act with their vitality, those who make it appear will act with thoughts, those who establish (do) do not distract will act with determination, those who know will act with wisdom, the one who knows to walk with the act of knowledge, In this way, the one who walks in the way makes all the good dhamma survive. “Walking in order to walk,” in this way those who walk the way reach excellence.</p>
<p>The next eight types of behavior: the seeing behavior of the righteous person, the (heart-)oriented behavior of the righteous person, the taking and receiving behavior of the righteous person, the innocent behavior of the righteous person, the hard working behavior of the righteous person, the present action of the mindful person, the non-scattering action of the right minded person [Ps.1,12].</p>
<p>“Like a rhinoceros,” the rhinoceros is truly unique. In the same way, the one who is enlightened alone is like that one, equivalent to that one, and contrasting to that one. If it is too salty, it is called salty, if it is too bitter, it is called bitterness, if it is too sweet, it is called like honey, if it is too hot, it is called like fire, if it is too cold, it is called like ice, and disciples who reach great supernatural power are called as a master. Similarly, the alone-enlightened person is there like that one, equal to that, contrasted to that, alone without partner (no duality), free from bondage, and he walks, lives, and acts correctly in the world, guards, makes survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>122 · From connections formed arises love (affection),<br />
And from love arises suffering,<br />

</blockquote>

The jailers imposed five types of punishment on him: they made the red hot iron rod pass through the (first) palm, and they made the red hot iron rod pass through the (second) palm. After the second palm, they passed the red hot iron rod through the (first) sole of the foot, they passed the red hot iron rod through the second sole of the foot, and they passed the red hot iron rod through the chest in the middle. He felt bitter, fierce, violent, [MN.129], pungent feelings, and he would not die until the evil kamma was eliminated. Where did this terror, suffering, and sorrow arise? ….</p>

Perpetual evildoers, tortured without dying.<br />
The body is like fire, that of the dweller in this hell,<br />
The one with steady kamma, the fire has neither ashes nor soot.<br />
They run to the east, and from there to the west;<br />
The run to the north, and from there to the south;<br />
Everywhere they run, the doors are shut,<br />
The want to go forth, they seek for release.<br />
They can’t go forth from there, they obtain this by means of kamma,<br />
For those evildoers, their abundant kamma is not yet fully ripe.”</p>
<p>Where did this terror, suffering, and sorrow arise? It arises from his love, happiness, greed, joy and greed.</p>
<p>Again, all the suffering of hell, the suffering of the animal world, the suffering of the hungry ghost world, the suffering of humans, where those are arising, where are they produced, where did it happen, where was born, where did it appear, be arisen? It is produced, arises, is born, is generated, arises with his love as a condition, happiness as condition, greed as condition, joy and greed as condition.</p>

He is a person with evil desire, a person with a desire for nature, and a person with hope. He is a person who has clothes, food, shelter, necessities of the patient, and medical necessities. Hoping for more and rejecting clothes, refusal to give food, refusal to shelter, refusal of patients’ necessities and medical necessities, he said: “What do high-value clothes have for a Samaṇa!” It is appropriate that a Samaṇa should use rags from the mound room or garbage dump or in front of the shop to make coats of.
